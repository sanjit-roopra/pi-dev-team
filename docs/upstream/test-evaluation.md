# Test Evaluation and Architecture

This document explains how to evaluate how an existing application is tested and design a path toward a fast, deterministic, config-free CI gate that fully validates behavior — including cross-service interaction — without standing up the rest of the system.

## Purpose

The test evaluation workflow answers two questions: "how well is this application tested today?" and "what would a CD-aligned test architecture look like?" The result is an assessed gap list and a concrete migration path, not generated test code. Implementation of the migration goes to `/plan` or `/build`.

---

## Tools and Their Altitudes

Four tools operate at different scopes. Use the one that matches what you need.

| What you want | Tool | Altitude | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Advise on how to test a specific module or hard-to-test unit | `test-design-advisor` skill | Unit / module | Forward (design) |
| Review test files in a changeset for smells, quality, and a suite-wide Farley Score | `/test-design` | Per-file / changeset | Backward (review) |
| Audit the whole test suite's strategy, quadrant coverage, and automation maturity | `test-health` skill | Whole suite | Strategic rollup |
| Assess the application's test strategy against CD: per-component types, pre-merge gate determinism | `cd-test-architecture` skill | Whole application | Architecture |
| Consolidated analyze-then-improve orchestrator — lightweight by default, opts into heavier capabilities (Gherkin, mutation, refactor-for-testability) only when asked; always baselines before changing tests; ships a 10-section executive-summary report | `/test-improve` | Whole repository | Remediation |

**`test-design-advisor`** works at the module level: assess testability blockers, place each behavior on the pyramid, choose the right test double, and produce a behavior-preserving refactor sequence to introduce seams. It does not write tests. **Vocabulary is locked to MinimumCD** (static analysis / unit / component / contract / integration / E2E); prefer "contract test" over "narrow integration test" and gloss the alias once if it must be used. **The pyramid is a cost heuristic, not a target shape** — the advisor never emits "current shape vs recommended shape" tables or per-layer target counts; placements are per-behavior with a two-direction justification (why not the layer above or below). Any E2E placement must satisfy the [E2E justification gate](#the-e2e-justification-gate).

**`/test-design`** is the orchestrator command for the changeset-level workflow. It dispatches `test-review` (tactical quality: missing assertions, non-determinism mechanics, mock hygiene) and `test-smell-review` (design-level smells: xUnit smell taxonomy, double selection, pyramid placement) in parallel, scores **every existing test in the suite** with the **Farley Score** (via the `farley-score` skill — 8 properties, weighted 1–10), then optionally runs `test-design-advisor` for production code that has no tests or hard-to-test units. The aggregated report carries the headline Farley score independent of the changeset scope.

**`test-health`** is the **strategic-altitude** rollup over the whole repository. It maps coverage to the Agile Testing Quadrants, evaluates the suite's shape against the architecture, rolls up automation maturity and flaky-test signals, and produces an ordered improvement plan. It **delegates rather than re-derives**: CD-determinism + pipeline placement come from `cd-test-architecture`, per-file findings + Farley Score come from `/test-design`, assertion strength on critical-logic modules comes from `mutation-testing`. Use this for "audit our tests" / "test strategy review" / "is our testing healthy?".

**`cd-test-architecture`** works at the application level: inventory components and test suites, classify against the six MinimumCD test types, identify CD-fitness gaps, recommend a per-component target architecture (with the [E2E justification gate](#the-e2e-justification-gate) applied to every E2E recommendation), and produce a migration path. It does not write tests or edit code.

**`/test-improve`** is the **consolidated remediation altitude** — a ten-phase (0-9) orchestrator (approach contract → baseline → optional Gherkin → analyze → plan fixes → improve-without-refactoring → refactor decision → optional refactor-for-testability → validate → executive-summary report). It defaults to lightweight ceremony (mutation off, BDD `none`, no-refactor) and prompts for heavier capabilities on demand. Phase 1 (Analyze) delegates the entire analysis to `/test-health`, which in turn folds in `cd-test-architecture` (advisory), `/test-design`, and `mutation-testing` — Phase 1 runs after Baseline and Derive Gherkin so `/test-health` can use documented-but-untested Gherkin scenarios as a coverage signal. See the workflow diagram in [Architecture](agent-architecture.md#test-improvement-workflow-test-improve).

**How they compose.** Start at the altitude that matches the question. `test-health` calls `/test-design`, `cd-test-architecture`, and `mutation-testing` internally — when the question is strategic, do not dispatch the lower-altitude tools yourself. `/test-design` calls `test-design-advisor` internally when `--advise` applies. `/test-improve` delegates its entire Phase 1 (analyze) to `/test-health` — when the question is "how do we get from this assessment to passing CD gates?", start with `/test-improve` and let it dispatch the analysis itself. When two altitudes plausibly fit, prefer the higher one and let it delegate down.

## The Evaluation Workflow

The `cd-test-architecture` skill follows these steps. Run it with `/cd-test-architecture <path>`.

### Step 1: Inventory the application's components

Map each deployable or testable surface and assign it a pattern from `knowledge/component-test-patterns.md`:

- **UI** — User Interface
- **Services** — API Provider, API Consumer, Event Consumer, Event Producer, Stateful Service, CLI/Library
- **Batch** — Scheduled Job

A real system is usually several of these. Each surface is assessed separately.

### Step 2: Inventory and classify existing tests

Find every test suite in the repo. For each, record: MinimumCD type, what it actually exercises, whether it is deterministic, and what it requires to run (DB URL, broker, downstream service, secrets, sleep, real clock).

If in-repo tests are sparse, the application is not necessarily untested — see Step 2b (locate and harvest out-of-repo tests) before concluding.

### Step 2b: Locate and harvest out-of-repo tests

When `--external-tests <path-or-repo-or-description>` is given, treat the external location as the current specification of intended behavior:

- **Other-repo suites** — read and classify just like in-repo tests; note they can't gate this component's merges.
- **Postman/Insomnia/`.http` collections** — extract each request + assertion as an API contract and scenario.
- **Manual scripts or spreadsheets** — extract each step as a behavior to automate.

This produces a behavior inventory that becomes the basis for improvement, not the destination.

### Step 3: Diagnose CD-fitness gaps

Flag, with evidence:

- Out-of-repo or third-party-runner testing (anti-pattern — see below)
- Manual / non-repeatable testing
- Tests mistyped as "unit" that require real dependencies
- Configured-dependency tests that can't run in a clean CI gate
- Coverage gaps (success + failure modes not covered at any deterministic layer)
- Doubles with no validation loop (drift risk)
- No consumer resilience tests (the component assumes the provider holds)
- Inverted pyramid shape (integration/E2E doing what component tests should)

### Step 4: Recommend the target architecture

Per component: which test types cover which layers, what to double to run pre-merge without configuration, which success scenarios and failure modes to cover, the double-validation loop, and the pipeline stage for each test type (pre-merge gate, Stage 1/2, out-of-band, or post-deploy).

The recommendation applies the [E2E justification gate](#the-e2e-justification-gate) to every E2E test. The pyramid is treated as a cost heuristic — no per-layer target counts are recommended; if the shape is pathological (ice-cream cone, hourglass, cupcake), the pathology and the behaviors that suffer from it are named, not a numeric redistribution.

### Step 5: Produce a migration path

Ordered lowest-risk first, each step independently shippable. The spine is **baseline before refactor**: get behavior under test at existing seams *without changing code*, then refactor under that green baseline. When tests are out-of-repo, the harvested behaviors feed that baseline. Typical full sequence:

1. **Characterization baseline (no refactoring)** — outside-in tests at the outermost reachable seam that lock in current behavior; reproduce any harvested out-of-repo/manual behaviors here. Get green.
2. Introduce owned adapters and seams **under the baseline** (DDD skills suggest where boundaries belong)
3. Add in-memory doubles + component tests reproducing the baselined behaviors
4. Add contract tests pinning request/response boundaries
5. Add consumer resilience tests (verify the component survives a provider break)
6. Add scheduled provider-contract verification against a test environment
7. Move real-dependency tests off the gate to adapter integration or out-of-band
8. Add post-deploy checks
9. Decommission out-of-repo/manual suites and the coarse characterization tests as their behaviors land in the deterministic gate

### Step 6: Report

Output goes to `.dev-team-reports/cd-test-architecture-<app>.md`. Tables, not prose: components and patterns, current tests and their CD-fitness, gaps, target architecture, pre-merge gate composition, migration path, next steps.

---

## When the Tests Aren't in the Repo

An application may have little or no in-repo testing and instead be covered by suites in another repo, a third-party runner, Postman or Insomnia collections, or manual scripts. This is an **anti-pattern** regardless of how thorough the external coverage is:

- The tests **cannot gate the component's own merges** — the build can go green while behavior is broken.
- The tests are **not versioned with the code** they verify; a code change and its test change can't move together.
- External suites are usually **non-deterministic and environment-coupled**, so they could never serve as a pre-merge gate anyway.
- **Manual scripts are not repeatable** — they're a checklist, not a regression net.

This does not mean the external coverage is worthless. It is the **current specification of intended behavior** — the best available basis for improvement.

To include it in the assessment, point the skill at it:

```
/cd-test-architecture <path> --external-tests <postman-collection.json>
/cd-test-architecture <path> --external-tests <path-to-other-repo>
/cd-test-architecture <path> --external-tests "manual regression scripts in Confluence, linked here: ..."
```

The skill harvests those sources as a behavior inventory (Step 2b — locate and harvest out-of-repo tests) and builds the migration path around re-expressing each behavior as a deterministic, in-repo, gated test:

| External source | Re-expressed as |
|---|---|
| Postman request + assertion | Component or contract test |
| Manual UI script | UI component test (real browser, network stubbed) |
| Other-repo E2E covering this component | In-repo component test + thin post-deploy smoke |

Each external case is decommissioned once its behavior lands in the gate.

If in-repo tests are sparse but no `--external-tests` location is given, the skill will **ask** where the application is actually tested before drawing any conclusions.

---

## Key Principles

### Pre-merge gate: deterministic tests only

The gate that blocks a merge may contain **only** static analysis, unit, component, and contract tests. These are deterministic and need nothing configured. Integration and end-to-end tests are non-deterministic by nature and never gate a merge. A test that needs a database URL, broker, downstream service, or environment secrets to run is mis-typed — re-classify or convert it.

The corollary is that E2E is the last resort, not a quota. The [E2E justification gate](#the-e2e-justification-gate) ensures recommendations don't propose E2E "for completeness" or "to round out the pyramid" — if a contract, component, or resilience test can cover a behavior, that's where it goes.

### The E2E justification gate

This is the single rule every tool and workflow step below applies to any E2E recommendation. An E2E test is recommended **only** when all four conditions hold:

1. A contract test cannot pin the boundary.
2. A component test with doubles cannot exercise the behavior.
3. A resilience test cannot cover the failure mode.
4. The behavior is a critical multi-component user journey.

An E2E recommendation that fails any of (1)–(3) is replaced with the cheaper layer that *can* cover it. **E2E is never a pre-merge gate.**

### Run CI without configuring dependencies

The component test is the workhorse of a CD gate. The pattern is consistent across every component type:

1. Assemble the **real component** — actual handlers, domain logic, orchestration — in-process.
2. Replace only what the team doesn't control with **in-memory doubles**: in-memory repository for the database, in-memory bus for the broker, stubbed adapter for downstream services, injected fixed clock.
3. Drive it through its **public interface** — HTTP handlers, message handler, job entrypoint, UI via a real browser with the network stubbed.
4. Assert **observable outcomes** — status, persisted state, emitted event, rendered output — never internal call sequences.

The result: fast (no I/O), deterministic (no real systems, controlled clock), zero configuration of the surrounding system — while still validating real behavior end-to-end within the component boundary.

### The adapter rule

Wrap every third-party client (SDK, HTTP client, broker client, DB driver) in a thin adapter the team owns. Double the adapter in component tests — never mock the third-party SDK directly. Adapter integration tests then exercise the real adapter against a real container to confirm the adapter's correctness.

### Do not depend on provider cooperation

Consumer-driven contract verification where the provider runs your contract in their pipeline only works with close collaboration and enforced tooling. Assume you do not have that. The defense you own:

1. **Contract tests** (pre-merge) pin the request you send and the response shape you depend on, against the adapter double.
2. **Scheduled provider-contract verification in a test environment** — you run your pinned contract against the provider's real non-prod endpoint on a schedule, out-of-band, owned by your team. This detects a provider break when it happens, not at your next unrelated deploy.
3. **Resilience component tests** (pre-merge) verify the consumer survives a broken contract: timeouts enforce, retries and circuit breakers behave, malformed responses are handled, the caller gets a documented response with no partial state.

Provider-side verification of your contract is a bonus if they offer it — not the mechanism to rely on.

### Baseline before refactor (legacy code)

Legacy code is code without tests (regardless of age). When a component is poorly tested, **do not lead with refactoring**:

1. **Find the testable seams** — places where behavior can be observed or substituted without editing the code (HTTP handler, CLI entrypoint, message handler, exported function, existing injection points).
2. **Write the best outside-in tests achievable now, without refactoring** — characterization tests at the outermost reachable seam that lock in current behavior. This is a behavior baseline, not yet a clean gate.
3. **Get the baseline green** — your safety net.
4. **Refactor to improve testability under green** — introduce adapters and seams, push checks down to deterministic component/unit tests. Never change behavior and structure in the same step.
5. **Let the domain guide the target** — the `domain-driven-design` and `domain-analysis` skills suggest where boundaries and seams should land.

The mechanics live in the [`legacy-code`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/legacy-code/SKILL.md) skill; this workflow places it in the CD test architecture. An assessment of an under-tested component therefore returns two things: the outside-in baseline writable today, and the refactor sequence that improves testability afterward.
