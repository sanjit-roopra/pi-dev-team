# Workflows

This page documents every user-invocable command in the dev-team plugin by capability group.
Commands within each group are split into two tiers:

- **Multi-agent (orchestrators)** — dispatch more than one Agent tool call per invocation, directly
  or via delegation, and may include human gates.
- **Standalone (single-pass)** — single-agent or self-contained; return in one pass without
  inter-phase human gates.

The two multi-phase pipelines with inter-phase gates are [`/ship`](#ship) —
whose full phase table appears at the end of this page — and
[`/test-improve`](#test-improve), whose phase reference lives on its own page,
[test-improve.md](test-improve.md).

## Multi-Phase Pipeline Reference

The two commands below are the plugin's **multi-phase pipelines with inter-phase human gates**.

---

## `/ship`

**File:** [`skills/ship/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/ship/SKILL.md)
**Role:** orchestrator.
**Use when:** the user says "ship this", "take this feature end to end", or
wants the spec → plan → build → PR flow without re-assembling it each time.

### Steps

| # | Step | Delegates to | Human gate after? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Approach contract** — screen request against [`knowledge/decision-defaults.md`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/knowledge/decision-defaults.md); resolve ambiguous high-reversal-cost axes in one batch. | (orchestrator only) | yes, if a blocker remains |
| 2 | **Spec** *(skipped with `--skip-spec`)* — produce Intent, Architecture, Acceptance Criteria. | [`/specs`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/specs/SKILL.md) | **yes** — operator approves the spec |
| 3 | **Plan** — decompose into vertical slices with Gherkin scenarios; a tier-scaled set of plan-review personas (1–5, by plan complexity) runs in parallel before the gate. | [`/plan`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/plan/SKILL.md) | **yes** — operator approves the plan |
| 4 | **Build** — small per-behavior batches per slice (Code-First Small Batches), inline review checkpoints, verification evidence. Do not proceed until the suite is green. | [`/build`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/build/SKILL.md) | no |
| 5 | **Review** — run quality-review agents and let the auto-fix loop converge. Only judgment-call findings escalate to the operator. | [`/code-review`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/code-review/SKILL.md) | no |
| 6 | **PR** — pre-PR quality gate, open PR, arm auto-merge by default (`--no-auto-merge` to opt out). | [`/pr`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/pr/SKILL.md) | **yes** — the PR is the final review artifact |
| 7 | **Report** — PR URL, quality-gate result, whether auto-merge is armed. | (orchestrator only) | — |

### Agents involved (dispatched by the delegated skills)

`/build`'s inline review checkpoints dispatch the review agents listed in
[`team-structure.md` → Review Agent Dispatch](team-structure.md#review-agent-dispatch-phase-3-inline-checkpoints).
`/plan` dispatches a tier-scaled subset of the five plan-review persona
agents (`agents/plan-review-*.md`) — the Acceptance Test Critic always
runs; the rest are added as the plan's tier (`trivial`/`standard`/`complex`)
warrants — and the
[`progress-guardian`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/agents/progress-guardian.md) gate-keeper.
`/code-review` re-runs the same review agents over the full changeset.

### Arguments

`/ship <feature-description> [--skip-spec] [--no-auto-merge]`

| Flag | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `<feature-description>` | Positional. The feature to build (required). |
| `--skip-spec` | Skip the spec phase (use when a spec already exists for this work). |
| `--no-auto-merge` | Open the PR without arming auto-merge. |

### Notes

- Sequencing only — every gate, fix loop, and evidence requirement comes from
  the underlying skills. If any phase stops at a gate, `/ship` stops with it.
- For a plan-only pass, use [`/plan`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/plan/SKILL.md);
  for build-only, use [`/build`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/build/SKILL.md).
- Resume across sessions with [`/continue`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/continue/SKILL.md).

## `/test-improve`

**File:** [`skills/test-improve/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/test-improve/SKILL.md)
**Role:** orchestrator.

The full ten-phase (0-9) reference — phase-by-phase gates, arguments, and the
flow diagram — lives on its own page: **[test-improve.md](test-improve.md)**.

---

## Cross-command lifecycle

Use `/test-improve` alongside `/ship` for multi-phase quality pipelines — run
`/test-improve` to raise baseline coverage and health first, then `/ship` to
carry the feature through spec → build → PR.

`/ship` and `/test-improve` are the two **multi-phase pipelines with
inter-phase human gates** in the plugin. Every other slash
command is either a single-step worker (e.g. `/coverage-baseline`,
`/triage`) or a one-shot orchestrator that returns in a single pass (e.g.
`/code-review`, `/test-design`). Knowing the phase order, the owning skill
or agent for each step, and where the human gates fall is the difference
between operating these workflows confidently and re-reading every SKILL.md
each time.

One cross-command lifecycle *is* documented separately: the defect workflow
that connects `/triage`'s triage records, `/code-review`'s correction
prompts, and `/apply-fixes` — from discovery to applied fix, including who
owns leftover `corrections/` files — lives in
[triage-workflow.md](triage-workflow.md).
