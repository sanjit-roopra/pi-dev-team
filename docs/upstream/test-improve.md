# `/test-improve`

**File:** [`skills/test-improve/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/test-improve/SKILL.md)
**Role:** orchestrator.

`/test-improve` is the **consolidated** analyze-then-improve orchestrator for
legacy or in-flight test suites, and one of the plugin's two multi-phase
pipelines with inter-phase human gates (the other is [`/ship`](workflows.md#ship)).
It defaults to lightweight ceremony, prompts for heavier capabilities
(Gherkin extraction, mutation testing, refactor-for-testability) only on
demand, and always baselines coverage (and mutation, when enabled) before any
test change.

This page is the canonical phase reference. For where `/test-improve` sits
among the plugin's other commands see [workflows.md](workflows.md); for how it
fits the wider agent architecture see
[agent-architecture.md](agent-architecture.md#test-improvement-workflow-test-improve).

## Phases

Each phase writes a progress file to
`.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/phase-<n>.md` so `/continue` (and `--from-phase`)
can resume.

**Execution order.** Phases keep their historical identity numbers (Phase 1
is always Analyze, Phase 2 is always Baseline, etc.), but **Baseline (Phase 2)
and Derive Gherkin (Phase 3) execute before Analyze (Phase 1)** so
`/test-health` can use documented-but-untested Gherkin scenarios as a
coverage signal: `0 → 2 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9`. Phase 7 and Phase 8
are **not alternatives** — when Phase 6 returns `[y]`, both run in sequence;
otherwise Phase 8 follows Phase 6 directly. When the BDD binding mode is
`none`, Phase 3 is skipped and the sequence becomes
`0 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9`. The list below follows this execution
order, not numeric order. The phase-start banner prints a separate
`Step <position>/<total> — Phase <N>: <name>` counter — `<position>` is a
running count of phases printed so far this run (never a fixed per-identity
slot), and `<total>` is computed per run (base 9, -1 when BDD binding mode
is `none`, +1 once Phase 6 enters Phase 7) rather than a hardcoded 9 or 10.

- **Phase 0 — Approach contract.** Batched prompt (Enter accepts all
  defaults): mutation mode `[kill-loop]` (`off` / `kill-loop` /
  `baseline+kill-loop`), BDD rubric `[none]`, refactor `[no-refactor]`,
  quality targets, sink (`--parent <url>` vs local files), and the all-or-none
  code-lookup install (explicit `y`/`n`, not part of Enter-accepts-all). An
  Enter-through run now performs the mutant-kill loop by default. Go stack shows
  the alpha go-mutesting advisory before the mutation prompt. Answers are
  immutable for the run. A stated coverage target that is structurally
  unreachable under `no-refactor` is surfaced here as `[w] waive / [s] switch
  to refactor-allowed / [c] continue as-is`, computed by
  `scripts/coverage_gap_ranking.py`; with no coverage report on disk yet the
  check is recorded `deferred` and re-run at Phase 2 (#1787).
- **Phase 2 — Baseline (before any test edit).**
  `/coverage-baseline --workflow test-improve` unconditionally;
  `/mutation-testing --baseline --workflow test-improve` only in
  `baseline+kill-loop` mode (`off` and `kill-loop` take no baseline).
  Go = advisory-only marker. Honest score = hard kills, timeouts separate.
  Then `scripts/coverage_gap_ranking.py` writes
  `data/coverage-gap-ranking.json` — per-module buckets ranked by uncovered
  lines descending, each marked `seam: established|absent` — the targeting
  input Phases 1, 4, and 5 read instead of mutation survivors (#1786), and the
  place a deferred Phase-0 conflict check resolves.
- **Phase 3 — Derive Gherkin (conditional).** `none` skips entirely (Phase 1
  follows Phase 2 directly in that case); `xunit-with-annotations` writes
  `.feature` files without a runner; `bdd-runner` wires the native parser.
- **Phase 1 — Analyze.** Delegate to `/test-health` (sole worker). No
  separate calls to `/cd-test-architecture`, `/test-design`,
  `/mutation-testing`. Whenever a coverage percentage is a stated goal, the
  improvement plan's coverage-driven items are ordered by
  `coverage-gap-ranking.json` rank, never by mutation survivor count —
  survivors order work only *within* a `seam: established` module (#1786).
  Mutation section respects Phase-0 setting. A
  separate, direct classification pass persists a before-snapshot of test
  counts by MinimumCD type to `test-counts-before.json`. `--analyze-only`
  runs Phase 0 then this phase directly, bypassing the Baseline/Derive-Gherkin
  ordering above, and exits with no baseline captured.
- **Phase 4 — Plan fixes.** `/issues-from-assessment --workflow test-improve`
  partitions findings into `NO_REFACTOR` (Phase-5 Stories) /
  `REFACTOR_REQUIRED` (deferred to Phase 7) / `LOW_VALUE` (advisory-only). The
  NO_REFACTOR Story set is written in `coverage-gap-ranking.json` rank order
  when a coverage percentage is a stated goal (#1786).
- **Phase 5 — Improve without refactoring.** Per Story: `/build`
  (no-refactor) → `/coverage-delta --workflow test-improve --story <id>` →
  `scripts/coverage_delta_steering.py` (three consecutive near-zero-delta
  Stories exit 3 and prompt `[t] re-check Phase-1 targeting / [c] continue`
  mid-phase, #1790) → `mutation-kill` agent, dispatched once per module batch
  (`--file <every story file in the batch> --max-rounds 3
  --target-honest-score <Phase-0 mutation target>`, #2030; `[c/r/w/q]` on
  residuals) → `scripts/mutation_yield_steering.py` at the batch boundary
  (two consecutive batches killing fewer than the minimum net survivors exit
  3 and prompt the same `[t] re-check Phase-1 targeting / [c] continue`,
  #2033 — the #1790 mechanism ported to the more expensive lane, sharing its
  status vocabulary and exit-code contract). End-of-phase review loop
  dispatches `/code-review --since <base-sha> --internal` once — not a
  separate `/test-design` dispatch in parallel with it; `test-review` and
  `test-smell-review` (the two agents `/test-design` used to add) are
  already in `/code-review`'s own roster for a test/seam-scoped diff, so
  that dual dispatch was a duplicate and #1966/#1987 removed it — confirms
  those two test lenses weren't dropped by the change-size gate, scores
  Farley on the in-scope test files, `/apply-fixes` then a narrowed
  re-confirmation (not a full re-dispatch), cap 2 iterations, `[r/w/q]`
  escalation. See `references/review-loop.md` steps 1-5. Evidence in
  `phase-5-review.json`.
- **Phase 6 — Refactor decision prompt.** `[y] enter Phase 7 / [b] backlog
  and skip to Phase 8 / [q] quit`. The letter `y` is deliberately chosen over
  `r`, which is already claimed by mutation-kill's `[c/r/w/q]` (retry) and the
  review loop's `[r/w/q]` (revise).
- **Phase 7 — Refactor-for-testability (conditional).** Only when `[y]`.
  Seam-only production-code changes; existing tests are immutable. Each Story
  precondition-checks the paired Phase-5 baseline is closed and green. Same
  end-of-phase review loop; evidence in `phase-7-review.json`.
- **Phase 8 — Validate.** `/quality-targets-converge --workflow test-improve
  --refactor-mode <value>` — threading Phase 0's `no-refactor`/
  `refactor-allowed` value keeps the coverage-gap dispatch table from
  proposing a `[Refactor-for-testability]` Story once no-refactor was
  already chosen at Phase 6; it writes a `refactor-backlog.md` entry
  instead. Mutation off = skipped (not waived). Go = advisory-only.
  Coverage < 90% in no-refactor mode → `[y/n]` re-run-in-refactor-allowed
  prompt lists backlogged items and records `coverage_reprompt_fired: true`
  in `phase-8.md` (so Phase 9's close-out prompt below doesn't re-ask). The
  identical classification pass from Phase 1 recounts test-by-type into
  `test-counts-after.json`. `/handoff` is suggested here, and after Phase 1
  and the Phase 5/7 review loops — the context-heaviest boundaries.
- **Phase 9 — Executive-summary report.** Interpolates the shipped
  [`templates/executive-summary.md`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/test-improve/templates/executive-summary.md)
  from the git-tracked `.dev-team-reports/test-improve/<slug>/data/`
  directory plus `.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/` process/audit state to
  `.dev-team-reports/test-improve/<slug>/report-<date>.md`. 10 numbered sections;
  empty sections render "Not applicable" (never omitted). § 1 includes a
  "Tests by type" table (Baseline/Achieved/Δ per MinimumCD type). § 7
  foregrounds a seam-needed/behavior-gained/estimated-risk table sourced
  from `refactor-backlog.md`. Parent tracker (or
  `.claude/plans/test-improve/FEATURE.md`) is updated with a link to the report.
  Report is regeneratable from memory. After Phase 9, if
  `refactor-backlog.md` has entries and Phase 8's re-run prompt never fired
  this run, a close-out `[y/n]` prompt asks whether to re-run with
  refactor-allowed mode.

## Arguments

`/test-improve <repo-path> [--parent <url>] [--analyze-only] [--from-phase <n>] [--stack <id>]`

| Flag | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `<repo-path>` | Positional. Path to the repository to improve (required). |
| `--parent <url>` | Post progress and Stories to this tracker issue URL instead of local plan files. |
| `--analyze-only` | Run Phase 0–1 only; skip improvement phases. |
| `--from-phase <n>` | Resume from phase `n` (requires existing `.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/` files). |
| `--stack <id>` | Override auto-detected stack identifier (e.g. `go`, `python`, `java`). |

`/continue` resumes any phase from `.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/phase-<n>.md`;
`--from-phase <n>` does the same explicitly and never re-prompts Phase 0.
`--analyze-only` runs Phase 0 + Phase 1 and exits before baseline capture.
