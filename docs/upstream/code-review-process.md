# Code Review Process

How `/code-review` (and its alias `/review`) works end-to-end: from invocation to final report, including the auto-fix loop and the artifacts it produces.

## What it does

`/code-review` is an **orchestrator-only** workflow. It does not review code itself — it dispatches a suite of focused review agents in parallel, aggregates their structured findings, optionally auto-fixes actionable issues in a bounded loop, and produces a health-scored report.

It follows the [Minimum CD agent configuration](https://migration.minimumcd.org/docs/agentic-cd/agent-configuration/) pattern: delegate all semantic analysis, minimize context passed to each agent, run cheap deterministic checks before spending tokens on AI, and return structured results.

## Invocation

```bash
/code-review                    # auto-scope
/code-review --path src/auth    # targeted directory
/code-review --since main       # everything changed since ref
/code-review --all              # full repository
/code-review --agent test-review  # single agent (delegates to /review-agent)
/code-review --json             # machine-readable output (CI)
/code-review --background       # drift review (no gates, structural agents only)
/code-review --force --reason "release freeze"  # skip gates, logged
```

### 1. Determine target files

File scope is resolved with this priority: `--path` → `--since` → `--all` → **auto-scope**.

Auto-scope (the default) runs `git diff --name-only` plus `git diff --cached --name-only`. If either shows changes, only those files are reviewed. If the working tree is clean, the full repository is reviewed.

| File count (full-repo mode) | Behavior |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| ≤ 200 | Proceed |
| 201–500 | Warn, proceed |
| > 500 | Warn and request confirmation |

### 1a. Documentation-only short-circuit

After the target set is known, if **every** file is documentation, `/code-review` short-circuits: it emits `Documentation-only changeset — skipping code review`, writes the `.pr-review-passed` gate file when auto-scoped to uncommitted changes (so the eventual `gh pr create` isn't blocked, #1886), and stops before any gate or agent runs. In `--json` mode it emits `{"status": "skipped", "reason": "documentation-only"}`.

Documentation = `.md`/`.mdx`/`.rst`/`.txt`/`.adoc`, `docs/**`, and root docs (`README*`, `CHANGELOG*`, `LICENSE*`, …) — **except functional Claude-config markdown** (`.claude/**`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `prompts/`, `knowledge/`, `templates/agents/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`), which is always reviewed. `--force --reason`, `--agent`, and `--background` bypass the short-circuit.

### 1b. Institutional context

If `REVIEW-CONTEXT.md` exists at the repo root, its contents are read and passed to every agent as "Institutional context provided for this review". This is where a team records domain knowledge, related services, known quirks, or architectural history that agents cannot discover from code alone. The file is optional.

### 1c. Optional MCP tools

The orchestrator probes for enhanced analysis tools (RoslynMCP, code knowledge graph, documentation MCP, Semgrep) and records availability. Agents fall back to Glob/Grep/Read when a tool is unavailable — all agents work without them. Tool availability appears in the final report.

### 2. Pre-flight gates (fail fast, fail cheap)

Deterministic checks run before any AI agent is invoked. Cheaper checks block expensive ones.

| # | Gate | Tool | Stops on |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| 1 | Lint | `npx eslint` (or project's lint) | errors |
| 2 | Type check | `npx tsc --noEmit` (if `tsconfig.json` exists) | errors |
| 3 | Secret scan | grep for common secret patterns | any match |
| 4 | Semgrep SAST | `semgrep scan --config auto` | ERROR-severity findings |
| 5 | Pipeline-red check | `gh run list` on current branch | failing CI (warn only) |

Missing tools are skipped silently. Gate failures stop the pipeline — no agents run. `--force --reason "<text>"` skips all gates (and the step-1a documentation-only short-circuit) and logs an entry to `.claude/metrics/override-audit.jsonl`. `--background` skips gates entirely.

### 2b. Static analysis pre-pass

If static analysis tools are available (Semgrep, ESLint, TypeScript, Ruff, mypy), they run against the target files and collect structured findings. Results are **deduplicated across tools** and injected into each agent's prompt as pre-confirmed context:

> "These issues were detected by static analysis tools. Do not re-report them. Focus on semantic and architectural concerns."

Unlike pre-flight gates, the pre-pass never stops the pipeline — its purpose is to give agents a head start. If Semgrep already ran in gate 4, findings are reused rather than re-collected. See [`skills/static-analysis-integration/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/static-analysis-integration/SKILL.md) for detection, execution, and deduplication rules.

### 3. Select enabled agents

All review agents in `agents/*.md` that declare an `effort:` band are enabled by default. Two language-agnostic agents always run regardless of tech stack:

- `doc-review` — README, API docs, inline comments, ADRs
- `arch-review` — layer boundaries, dependency direction, pattern consistency

`claude-setup-review`, `token-efficiency-review`, and `ai-provenance-review` are deliberately absent (#1733). `claude-setup-review` reviews the **harness** rather than the changeset, so it had nothing to say about a diff — `Scope: always` put it in an 18-lens panel for a two-file JavaScript change in a project with no Claude configuration at all. `token-efficiency-review` (CLAUDE.md/rule verbosity, file-size drift) and `ai-provenance-review` (AI-provenance verification debt) are properties of the whole tree, not any single diff, for the same reason. All three are now dispatched instead by the whole-tree `/repo-review` command — `claude-setup-review` also stays reachable on demand via `/claude-setup-review`.

A project-local `review-config.json` can disable specific agents. `--background` mode restricts the run to `doc-review`, `arch-review`, `naming-review`, and `structure-review`.

### 4. Dispatch agents in parallel

Each enabled agent is spawned as a sub-agent via the Agent tool, all in a single message for maximum parallelism. Each sub-agent:

- Runs in isolation (context is **not** shared with the parent)
- Receives only the files matching its declared scope (e.g., `js-fp-review` gets JS/TS only)
- Receives the minimum context its `Context needs` field requires

| `Context needs` | Input | When to use |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| `diff-only` | Git diff output only | Pattern-matching agents (naming, FP) |
| `full-file` | Complete file contents | Agents needing function-level context |
| `project-structure` | Full files + directory tree | Agents reasoning about architecture |

When the target is the full repository (`--all`, `--path`, or clean auto-scope), agents always receive full files regardless of `Context needs`.

**Model selection** is declared per agent, not orchestrator-controlled. Each
agent declares `model:` (an alias, a full model ID, or `inherit`) and
`effort:` directly in its frontmatter — the native Claude Code sub-agent
contract, resolved by the harness itself before dispatch (ADR 0026).

Each agent returns a JSON result: `{agentName, status, modelTier, issues[], summary}`. See [`skills/code-review/output-format.md`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/code-review/output-format.md).

### 5. Aggregate results

**5a. ACCEPTED-RISKS suppression.** If `ACCEPTED-RISKS.md` exists at the repo root, its YAML rules are applied in declaration order. The first matching rule suppresses a finding and emits a one-line audit entry. Expired rules become inert and emit a WARN. Broad rules (wildcard `rule_id` or multi-file globs) emit an informational notice. Schema-invalid rules fail the run. Suppressed findings bypass the fix loop and appear in a dedicated report section grouped by rule id. See [`knowledge/accepted-risks-schema.md`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/knowledge/accepted-risks-schema.md).

**5b. Health scoring** per [`knowledge/review-rubric.md`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/knowledge/review-rubric.md):

| Score | Condition |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 🟢 HEALTHY | 0 fail AND ≤ 2 warn |
| 🟠 NEEDS ATTENTION | 1–2 fail OR 3+ warn |
| 🔴 CRITICAL | 3+ fail OR any `security-review` fail |

**Actionability classification** determines what the fix loop touches:
error/warning findings at high or medium confidence are auto-applied, and
everything else (any `confidence: none`, and all suggestions) is report-only.
The canonical rubric — severity × confidence → actionable — lives in the
[review-corrections flow](triage-workflow.md#4-the-review-corrections-flow).

### 6. Fix or report only?

If there are zero actionable issues, skip to report generation. Otherwise the orchestrator presents a summary and asks the user:

> **"Fix these issues automatically, or save as report only?"**

- **Fix** → enter the review-fix loop
- **Report only** → skip to report generation with all findings intact

**Exception — non-interactive mode**: when `/code-review` runs inside `/build` or `/pr`, the prompt is skipped and the fix loop runs automatically. The caller already owns the human gate — the orchestrator's Phase 3 approval for `/build`, and the pre-PR confirmation for `/pr`.

### 6a. Review-fix loop

```
iteration = 1
while actionable_issues > 0 and iteration ≤ 5:
    1. Apply fixes (file-by-file, top-to-bottom by line number)
    2. Run tests; if tests fail, revert the last fix and mark it human-required
    3. Re-run only the agents that reported actionable issues, against only the modified files
    4. Re-aggregate: merge new results with carry-forward passes
    5. iteration += 1
```

**Exit conditions**:

| Condition | Outcome |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Zero actionable issues | Converged → generate report |
| Iteration limit (5) reached | Escalate remaining issues to human |
| Same issues persist after fix attempt | Not converging → exit and escalate |
| Test failure after fix + revert | Mark issue human-required, continue |

The final report includes a loop table showing iterations, issues fixed, and agents re-run.

### 7. Generate report

Output format depends on the `--json` flag:

- **JSON** — a single aggregated object with overall status, per-agent results, totals, fix summary, and token estimate. Consumable by CI.
- **Prose** — a markdown report following [`knowledge/review-template.md`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/knowledge/review-template.md): summary table, pre-flight status, institutional context, issues by file (sorted by severity), loop iteration table, recommendations, tool availability.

Remaining issues (not auto-fixed) are tagged `[confidence: none]`, `[auto-fix failed — human review required]`, or `[suggestion]`.

### 8. Correction prompts

For every unfixed actionable issue — plus suggestions worth addressing — a correction prompt JSON is written to `corrections/`. Each prompt includes priority, confidence, category, instruction, context, affected files, and `autoFixResult`. These can be addressed manually or with [`/apply-fixes`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/apply-fixes/SKILL.md).

The full lifecycle of these files — discovery to applied fix, including who owns a `corrections/*.json` after its branch merges — is documented in [triage-workflow.md](triage-workflow.md).

### 9. Pre-PR gate file

When the review was auto-scoped to uncommitted changes, the final status is `pass` or `warn`, and step 6a's fix loop (if it ran) did not exit with actionable issues still outstanding, the orchestrator writes `.pr-review-passed` to `.claude/memory/` (#1886) — a SHA-256 hash of the branch's diff against its base (`git diff <base>...HEAD`), not just the staged patch — an edit or commit after review changes this hash and invalidates the gate:

```bash
HASH=$(python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/lib/review_gate_hash.py" --branch-diff)
mkdir -p .claude/memory && echo "$HASH" > .claude/memory/.pr-review-passed
```

Always use this shared helper, not a hand-rolled `git diff | shasum` pipeline — the helper pins several git config overrides (relative-path scoping, external diff drivers, submodule visibility) that a raw pipeline would not.

**#1886: the gate moved from `git commit` to `gh pr create`.** `hooks/pre_pr_review.py` reads `.claude/memory/.pr-review-passed` at PR-creation time, bound to the branch's diff vs. its base (`branch_diff_gate_hash()`), not the staged-patch hash (`review_gate_hash()`) the retired `.review-passed` used. `hooks/pre_commit_review.py` (the former reader of `.review-passed`) is now a documented no-op, and `.review-passed` itself is no longer written by this step or read by anything.

**Known limitation.** `agent_dispatch_ledger.py` still stamps every dispatch's corroborating evidence with the staged-patch hash, never the branch-diff hash. The two are identical only in the common single-commit-then-PR shape (branch cut from base, reviewed once while staged, committed, then a PR opened immediately) — a branch with multiple separate review-and-commit cycles will correctly fail this gate at `gh pr create` time and need a fresh `/code-review` run against its current diff. Closing this for every shape is tracked as a follow-up, not fixed here.

### Reasoned bypass (`PR_GATE_BYPASS_REASON`)

**#1886:** `git commit --no-verify`/`-n` + `GATE_BYPASS_REASON` was the
historical bypass for the commit-time gate — both still work as ordinary git
flags/env vars, but `hooks/pre_commit_review.py` no longer reads either, so
they no longer gate anything at commit time.

The current gate (`hooks/pre_pr_review.py`, triggered by `gh pr create`)
requires a non-empty `PR_GATE_BYPASS_REASON` environment variable to bypass
— `gh` has no native `--no-verify`-shaped flag, so the env var alone is both
the trigger and the reason:

```bash
PR_GATE_BYPASS_REASON="hotfix, review to follow" gh pr create ...
```

With it set, the hook allows the PR to open and appends an accountability
line — timestamp, branch, which mechanism triggered it, the reason,
branch-diff file count, and plugin version — to
`.claude/metrics/gate-bypass-audit.jsonl`, unconditionally (this log is not
gated by `DEV_TEAM_TELEMETRY`). Same accountability posture as the original
commit-time bypass (#709), relocated to the new trigger point (#1886).

## Artifacts

| Artifact | When | Purpose |
| ---------- | ------ | --------- |
| Stdout report (markdown or JSON) | Every run | Human or CI consumption |
| `corrections/*.json` | When unfixed actionable or suggestion issues remain | Feeds `/apply-fixes` |
| `.pr-review-passed` | Auto-scoped clean/warn runs | Read by `hooks/pre_pr_review.py` at `gh pr create` time (#1886 — see § 9 above) |
| `.claude/metrics/override-audit.jsonl` | `--force --reason ...` | Audit trail for skipped gates |
| `.claude/metrics/gate-bypass-audit.jsonl` | `gh pr create` with `PR_GATE_BYPASS_REASON` set (#1886) | Audit trail for reasoned pre-PR-gate bypasses |

## Customization points

| File | Location | Effect |
| ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| `review-config.json` | Project root | Disables specific agents per project |
| `REVIEW-CONTEXT.md` | Project root | Injects institutional knowledge into every agent's prompt |
| `ACCEPTED-RISKS.md` | Project root | Suppresses known findings with audit trail and expiry |

All three are optional and project-local — they are not part of the plugin.

## Relationship to other workflows

- **Inline review checkpoints** (Phase 3 of `/build`) use the same review-fix loop mechanics, but the orchestrator selects a **targeted** subset of agents based on what changed in the unit of work. `/code-review` is the **final gate** before commit and runs the full enabled suite.
- **[`/review-agent`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/review-agent/SKILL.md)** runs a single agent — used for targeted checks and as the worker for inline checkpoints.
- **[`/apply-fixes`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/apply-fixes/SKILL.md)** consumes the `corrections/` directory produced here.
- **[`/pr`](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/pr/SKILL.md)** runs `/code-review --json` as part of its pre-PR quality gate. It runs non-interactively (fix loop auto-applies, no "fix or report?" prompt) and `/pr` branches on the returned status — `overall: pass/warn` or `status: skipped` proceeds, `overall: fail` re-engages the user.

## Concurrent use

The `.pr-review-passed` gate is a single, gitignored file per working tree, so two
agents sharing **one** checkout overwrite each other's gate. Give each
concurrent agent its own git worktree — the full rationale and setup are in
[concurrent-use.md](concurrent-use.md).
