# Context Management

A user-facing guide to `hooks/context_ceiling_guard.py` — what it measures,
why the ceiling is set where it is, how to read the warning it prints, and
how to tune or troubleshoot it. For the runtime procedure this backs
(what to load, when), see [Context Loading
Protocol](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/context-loading-protocol/SKILL.md); for the
compression procedure it nudges toward, see
[Handoff](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/handoff/SKILL.md).

## What the guard is, and the evidence behind it

A `PreToolUse` hook registered on `Agent` and `Skill` — every capability
load (dispatching a sub-agent, invoking a skill) is a choke point where the
hook can measure real context occupancy before the call proceeds. Both are
measured and reported; only `Skill` is blocked (ADR 0039 — see Expectations). It reads
`utilization = (input + cache_read + cache_creation) / model_context_window`
from the session transcript's most recent assistant-message usage — ground
truth from the harness, not a model self-estimate (a model has no reliable
readout of its own context fill).

The 40% default ceiling is a conservative planning target, not a claimed
accuracy cliff:

- Chroma's [Context Rot study](https://www.trychroma.com/research/context-rot)
  found degradation across 18 models (including Claude 4) is gradual, not a
  sharp drop at any single percentage.
- Needle-in-a-haystack benchmarks like RULER and NoLiMa show a model's
  *effective* context is often only about half its advertised window, with
  sharp accuracy drops on non-lexical retrieval well before the window limit.
- Anthropic's [effective context engineering
  guidance](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents)
  recommends proactive compaction well ahead of the limit.

Given that evidence, budgeting to 40% of the window (capped at 350K
absolute) leaves headroom before quality degrades, rather than chasing a
precise threshold that doesn't exist.

The absolute cap sat at 150K until [ADR
0038](../../../docs/adr/0038-raise-the-absolute-context-ceiling-to-350k.md).
That number was the Claude *API's* managed-compaction default — a different
system's constant, borrowed for its authority rather than derived from this
plugin's own measurements — and on this repo's recorded corpus it landed
*below* the average per-turn occupancy of an ordinary multi-agent session,
so under the #2000 blocking default it would have stopped the median session
rather than the expensive tail. 350K keeps the entire measured cost case
(every session past 500K, and the 18 past 900K that were 29% of main-thread
spend) while sitting above normal working occupancy.

## Reading the warning line

The warning follows one pinned template, field by field:

```text
🪟 Context at {occ} of {window} tokens — over the effective ceiling of {eff} tokens ({bound} bound; window {provenance}) before {label}.
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `{occ}` | Measured occupancy in tokens (input + cache_read + cache_creation of the latest transcript usage line). |
| `{window}` | The resolved context window in tokens. |
| `{eff}` | The effective ceiling: `min(ceiling_pct% of window, abs_ceiling)`. |
| `{bound}` | Which threshold is binding — `percentage` or `absolute`. The two framings never co-occur; exactly one is reported. |
| `{provenance}` | Where `{window}` came from — `override` (`DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_WINDOW` set), `detected` (matched a pinned model family/version), or `default` (unrecognized model, or no model info — falls back to 200K). **`default` warns but never blocks** — see Expectations. |
| `{label}` | What triggered the check — `loading agent '<name>'` or `invoking skill '<name>'`. |

A second line follows, naming the Handoff action band for
the current occupancy (see below), and — for the two lower bands — a
knob-tuning footer.

## Graduated bands: concrete fire-points

Bands are keyed to multiples of the *effective ceiling* (`{eff}`), not raw
window percentage, so the table below applies whether the threshold landed
on the percentage bound or the absolute bound:

| Band | Multiple of `{eff}` | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| nudge | 1x – 1.25x | Consider running `/handoff`. |
| run-now | 1.25x – 1.5x | Run `/handoff` now. |
| full-summary (top band) | 1.5x+ | Write a full summary to `.claude/memory/` and start a new conversation. Leads with the directive; no knob footer. |

Concrete fire-points at default settings (`DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_CEILING_PCT=40`,
`DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_ABS_CEILING=350000`):

| Window | Effective ceiling (`{eff}`) | Bound | nudge fires at | run-now fires at | full-summary fires at |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 200K (e.g. Haiku) | 80,000 tokens | percentage (40% of 200K) | 80,000 | 100,000 | 120,000 |
| 1M (e.g. current Opus/Sonnet/Fable) | 350,000 tokens | absolute (350K cap < 400K) | 350,000 | 437,500 | 525,000 |

Note that the two regimes are the whole picture: the percentage bound governs
200K windows and the absolute cap governs 1M ones, so on any model this
plugin currently runs against, the effective ceiling is a flat 350,000 tokens
— 35% of the window, not 40%. `DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_CEILING_PCT` only becomes
load-bearing on a 200K window or if the cap is raised past 400K.

## Expectations

- **Blocking is the default (#2000) — for `Skill`.** At or above the ceiling
  a skill invocation writes to stderr and exits 2 — the call is blocked —
  with a `[blocked: context ceiling]` footer naming `/handoff` as the way
  out. Nothing is written to stdout.
- **Agent/Task dispatches warn but proceed (ADR 0039).** The two gated tools
  do opposite things to the measured quantity: a skill loads `SKILL.md` into
  *this* context, while a subagent runs in its own and returns only a result.
  Blocking a dispatch does not stop the work — it pushes the work inline,
  growing occupancy by more than delegating would have, so the guard would be
  making the number it protects worse. Dispatches still fire the full
  diagnostic and action bands, carrying a `[not blocked: delegation]` footer.
  `DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_GATE_AGENT=block` restores blocking for them.
- **Warn mode is opt-out.** `DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_STRICT=off` downgrades the
  block to a stderr warning with `exit 0`, the pre-#2000 behavior. Only the
  literal value `off` (case- and whitespace-insensitive) does this; every
  other value — including the historical opt-in spelling `on` — blocks, so a
  typo resolves toward enforcement rather than away from it.
- **Why it changed.** Warn-by-default was measured and did not hold: across
  2,393 sessions, 76 ran past 500K occupancy and 18 past 900K, with those 18
  alone accounting for 29% of main-thread spend at roughly 3x the per-turn
  cost of a sub-100K session. Recovery was invoked 3 times. An advisory
  ceiling reads as a guarantee and delivers none.
- **An unverified window warns, it does not block.** When the window's
  provenance is `default` — the model id is one the guard does not
  recognize — the threshold above it is a guess, so the verdict is
  downgraded to a warning carrying a `[not blocked: window unverified]`
  footer. Blocking there would stop every capability load from 80,000
  tokens onward on a 200K-fallback threshold even where the real window may
  be 1M, and every model
  released after the detection pattern was last edited lands in this case.
  Set `DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_WINDOW` to the model's real window to restore
  blocking; `override` and `detected` provenance block as normal.
- **Subagent turns are not main-thread occupancy.** Transcript rows marked
  `isSidechain` are excluded from both the occupancy scan and window
  detection. Their usage describes the subagent's own context, so counting
  them measures the wrong window in both directions — a small subagent turn
  recorded after a large main turn would hide a full context, and a large
  one would block a main thread nowhere near the ceiling.
- **Fail-open guarantees.** The hook never blocks a session because of its
  own failure: missing or unreadable transcript, malformed or empty stdin,
  unmeasurable usage, a malformed env var, or any internal parse error all
  resolve to a silent `exit 0`. A measurement failure is never treated as
  "over the ceiling."
- **Recovery skills are never gated**, strict mode included —
  `/handoff`, `/context-loading-protocol`, `/continue`,
  `/review-summary`, `/session-review` always proceed, so the path back
  under budget can never deadlock.
- **Per-session dedupe.** Repeated warnings at the same band and the same
  coarse 5%-of-window bucket are suppressed; a band escalation always
  breaks through even when the bucket hasn't moved.

## Knobs

| Env var | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_CEILING` | (unset = on) | `off` disables the guard entirely. |
| `DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_STRICT` | (unset = block) | `off` warns (`exit 0`) at or above the ceiling instead of blocking. Any other value blocks. |
| `DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_GATE_AGENT` | (unset = warn) | `block` also blocks `Agent`/`Task` dispatches over the ceiling. Only the literal `block` opts in — the opposite convention to `STRICT`, because here the expensive direction of failure is blocking a dispatch that should not be blocked. |
| `DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_CEILING_PCT` | `40` | Percentage-of-window threshold before the absolute cap is applied. |
| `DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_WINDOW` | (unset = auto-detect) | Overrides window auto-detection explicitly; always wins over detection. |
| `DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_ABS_CEILING` | `350000` | Absolute token cap on the effective threshold — `min(ceiling_pct% of window, this)`. Binding on every 1M-window model; a no-op on a 200K one. |

## Troubleshooting

**"Why does the warning say `window default` instead of `window
detected`?"** The transcript's `message.model` was missing, or didn't match
a known pinned family/version. This is a conservative fallback to 200K —
never a large window — so an unrecognized model never triggers an
under-nudge. See the family/version list in
[context-loading-protocol/SKILL.md](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/blob/main/plugins/dev-team/skills/context-loading-protocol/SKILL.md#enforcement).
If the model is a known large-window model that isn't in the pinned list
yet, set `DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_WINDOW` explicitly.

**"The window looks wrong for a model I know is 1M."** Only version-pinned
models auto-detect as 1M (Fable, Mythos, Opus 4.6/4.7/4.8, Sonnet 5, Sonnet
4.6) — window is a fixed per-model property, not a family-wide one, so a
same-family model outside that pinned list (e.g. an older Opus or Sonnet
snapshot) intentionally falls back to 200K rather than being assumed large.
Override with `DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_WINDOW=1000000` if you know better.

**"I ran `/handoff` but the guard still warned."** Recovery
skills are exempt from gating, but only the skills listed above — check the
skill name doesn't have a plugin prefix mismatch (`plugin:continue` is
recognized as the recovery `continue`, stripped of its plugin prefix).

**"Nothing fires even though I'm clearly over budget."** Check
`DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_CEILING` isn't set to `off`, and that the transcript path
passed to the hook is readable — a missing or unreadable transcript
fails open silently by design.
