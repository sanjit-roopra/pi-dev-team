"""Python port of hooks/context-ceiling-guard.sh (#595 / #572 Phase 3).

PreToolUse hook (Agent + Skill matchers). Enforces the context-window
ceiling from the Context Loading Protocol. Before a capability-loading call
— an Agent dispatch or a Skill invocation — it reads the *real* context
occupancy from the session transcript's most recent assistant-message usage
and compares it to the model's context window. Over the ceiling it nudges
the orchestrator to summarize (warn, the default) or blocks the load
(strict mode).

Utilization formula (identical in skills/context-loading-protocol/SKILL.md
and skills/handoff/SKILL.md — kept in sync by
tests/hooks/test_context_ceiling_guard.py's formula-equality test):
    utilization = (input + cache_read + cache_creation) / model_context_window

Why occupancy from the transcript and not a self-estimate: the model has no
reliable readout of its own context fill; the usage the harness recorded in
the transcript is the ground truth.

Posture: block-by-default (#2000), fail-open. Writes the message to stderr
and exits 2 to block over the ceiling, 0 to allow (or to warn under
`DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_STRICT=off`). Any error, unmatched tool, or unmeasurable
context → exit 0 — a measurement failure never blocks a session.

Why blocking is the default: warn-by-default was measured and did not hold.
Over 2,393 sessions the guard warned and was ignored — 76 sessions ran past
500K occupancy, 18 past 900K, and those 18 alone were 29% of main-thread
spend at roughly 3x the per-turn cost of a session under 100K. Recovery was
invoked 3 times. An advisory ceiling reads as a guarantee and delivers
none, so it now blocks and the operator opts out explicitly.

Recovery skills are never gated: blocking /handoff (the way
back under budget) would deadlock the session.

What blocks vs what warns (ADR 0039): a `Skill` invocation loads SKILL.md
into THIS context, so it grows the measured quantity and a block helps. An
`Agent`/`Task` dispatch runs in a separate context and returns only a
result, so blocking it does not stop the work — it pushes the work inline
and grows occupancy by more than the delegation would have. Agent dispatches
therefore warn (bands and all) but do not block. See `_BLOCKING_TOOLS`.

Two properties keep the blocking default honest, and both are pinned by
tests rather than left as prose:

* Sidechain (subagent) transcript rows are excluded from the scan — their
  usage describes the subagent's context, not the main thread's. See
  `_is_sidechain`.
* A ceiling computed against the unverified 200K fallback window warns
  instead of blocking. See `_UNVERIFIED_WINDOW_FOOTER`.

Env:
    DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_CEILING=off     disable entirely (default on)
    DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_STRICT=off      warn instead of blocking over the
                                     ceiling (default: block, #2000).
                                     Any other value, including the
                                     historical `on`, blocks.
    DEV_TEAM_CONTEXT_GATE_AGENT=block
                                     also BLOCK Agent/Task dispatches over
                                     the ceiling (default: warn only, ADR
                                     0039 — delegation reduces main-thread
                                     growth, so blocking it costs more than
                                     it saves). Skill invocations block
                                     regardless. Only the literal `block`
                                     opts in.

#: that "a wrong window can no longer brick a session, because a window it
#: cannot resolve does not produce a verdict at all" — which was not what the
#: code did: `_resolve_window` returns the 200K fallback and the guard went on
#: to a full blocking verdict against it. On a model whose real window is 1M
#: that blocks every capability load from 80K onward, i.e. at 8% of the real
#: window, and it does so for every model released after `_LARGE_WINDOW_RE`
#: was last edited. The conservative fallback's own rationale ("over-nudging a
#: 1M session is a minor false alarm") was written for the warn-by-default era
#: and does not survive the flip: an unverified window now warns, and only a
#: verified one — an explicit override or a recognized model — blocks.
