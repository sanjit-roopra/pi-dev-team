"""Python port of hooks/verify-guard.sh (#608 / #572 Phase 3), escalated to a
hard stop for stuck loops (#708).

PreToolUse Bash hook — detects repeated identical verify invocations
within a session. Once the same normalized command has run THRESHOLD
consecutive times with **zero** intervening Edit/Write/NotebookEdit calls
(tracked via verify_guard_edit_marker.py, its PreToolUse sibling on the
Write|Edit|NotebookEdit matcher), it BLOCKS the command instead of merely
warning — that combination is a genuinely stuck loop, not the ordinary
RED/GREEN/REFACTOR pattern of re-running the same command after each real
edit. Any edit observed since the previous verify run resets the counter,
same as a different command does, so legitimate TDD repeats are never
blocked.

Contract (docs/python-hook-contract.md):
    Input : PreToolUse JSON on stdin (hook_event_name, session_id,
            tool_input.command, cwd)
    Output: Warning on stdout below threshold; `[BLOCK]`-prefixed message
            at/above threshold (unless DEV_TEAM_VERIFY_THRESHOLD=0)
    Exit  : 0 below threshold, or when DEV_TEAM_VERIFY_THRESHOLD=0;
            2 (block) at/above threshold with threshold > 0
    Env   : DEV_TEAM_VERIFY_THRESHOLD (default 3), TMPDIR

Stdlib-only. See docs/python-hook-contract.md.
