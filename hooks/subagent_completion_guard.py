"""subagent_completion_guard.py — SubagentStop transcript-tail classifier (#2188).

Step 2.1a's research findings (below, preserved verbatim as the source citation
for the classifier Step 2.1b implements after them) confirmed the real
transcript-level shape of a subagent's completion against 70 real subagent
transcripts from this session. Step 2.1b (this implementation) turns those
findings into `classify_stop()`.

## Contract (docs/python-hook-contract.md)

    Input : SubagentStop JSON on stdin (`transcript_path`, `session_id`, `cwd`)
    Output: one `boundary-events.jsonl` `"record"`-decision row (#1461's
        non-verdict, observational sense -- this hook never blocks, warns,
        bypasses, intervenes, or reverts anything; see
        `knowledge/telemetry-schema.md`) via
        `hooks/lib/boundary_events.emit_boundary_event` for the two
        non-clean, explainable classifications (`empty-final-turn`,
        `truncated-final-turn`); nothing emitted for `clean` or
        `unreadable` (Step 2.2, see `_EMIT_CLASSIFICATIONS`).
    Posture: record-only and fail-open. Any error -> exit 0 silently.

Stdlib-only (json/pathlib/sys). See ADR 0014, ADR 0015.

## What was confirmed, and how

Primary source: this session's own subagent dispatch transcripts on disk at
    ~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/<session-id>/subagents/agent-<hash>.jsonl
(+ a sibling agent-<hash>.meta.json per dispatch). 70 completed subagent transcripts were
inspected directly (not recalled/guessed) — this is real, live harness output from
Claude Code 2.1.278, not documentation. No web-doc citation was needed or used since a
real transcript was reachable, per this step's own instructions.

Compared against `hooks/cost_meter.py` (reads `transcript_path` from the hook payload,
checks `.is_file()`, does not itself parse rows — delegates to
`hooks/lib/cost_meter.py record`) and `hooks/task_completion_metrics.py` (reads
`payload.get("stop_reason")` — informational only, never branches on it) for how
existing SubagentStop hooks already touch this payload, and against
`hooks/context_ceiling_guard.py`'s `_tail_lines`/`_is_sidechain`/`_measure_occupancy`
(lines 270-424) for the tail-reading and sidechain-row pattern.

## Finding 1 — where a subagent's own transcript lives, and what "sidechain" means here

A subagent's transcript is a SEPARATE file from the orchestrator/main-thread session
file, not inlined into it: `<session>.jsonl` (main thread) has a sibling
`<session>/subagents/agent-<hash>.jsonl` per dispatched subagent (confirmed: the main
thread's own `<session>.jsonl` had zero `"isSidechain":true` rows across 7798 lines,
while every row inside a per-agent `subagents/agent-*.jsonl` file is
`"isSidechain":true`). This matches Step 2.1b's own plan text precisely: for a
SubagentStop payload, the "sidechain" rows `context_ceiling_guard.py` excludes when
scanning the MAIN thread are exactly the subagent's own transcript rows when read from
its own file — nothing needs excluding when reading a subagent's transcript directly.

## Finding 2 — message.stop_reason IS present, but is null far more often than not

`message.stop_reason` uses the same field name and the same Anthropic Messages API
values (`end_turn` | `max_tokens` | `stop_sequence` | `tool_use`) as main-thread rows —
confirmed directly (e.g. a mid-turn row with `stop_reason:"tool_use"` on a finalized
tool_use block). However, across the true LAST row of 70 completed subagent transcripts:

    stop_reason == null        -> 61/70 (87%)
    stop_reason == "end_turn"  -> 8/70  (11%)
    stop_reason == "tool_use"  -> 1/70  (this session's own still-in-progress transcript
                                          at the time of sampling, not a stopped turn)
    stop_reason == "max_tokens" or "stop_sequence" -> 0/70 (no real example seen either
                                          way; both remain unverified against a real
                                          transcript — Anthropic's documented contract is
                                          the only source for those two values)

All 61 `null` cases were genuinely clean, complete hand-backs (e.g. "Report delivered.",
"Report delivered to caller.", "Handed back: skip — no `.feature` files..."), not
truncated or errored ones — content was well-formed, non-empty text every time. A
classifier that treats "clean" as `stop_reason in ("end_turn", "tool_use")` on the final
row alone will misclassify the large majority of real clean completions. Step 2.1b's
classifier needs "non-empty content AND stop_reason != 'max_tokens'" as the clean
signal, not a stop_reason allow-list — `null` must be treated as equivalent to clean,
not as an unhandled case. (This finding was outside Step 2.1a's edit mandate, which was
scoped to the malformed-hand-back scenario only, so the plan's Gherkin "Clean
completion" `Given` clause text was left unedited — flagged here and in the plan's
Risks & Open Questions section for Step 2.1b to account for.)

## Finding 3 — SubagentHandback is a real, distinguishable tool_use block

`SubagentHandback` (the tool a dispatched subagent calls to report back to its caller,
per this session's own system-prompt tool description) shows up as a genuine
`{"type":"tool_use","name":"SubagentHandback","input":{"message": "..."}}` block — 69
real occurrences found across the 70 transcripts. It is a real, greppable signal beyond
bare stop_reason+content.

It is essentially NEVER the transcript's true final row, though: every real example
followed the same shape — `tool_use` (SubagentHandback, stop_reason "tool_use") ->
`tool_result` (ack) -> one more short assistant text turn (stop_reason usually null, see
Finding 2) such as "Report delivered." That final wrap-up turn, not the SubagentHandback
call itself, is the transcript's real last row on a clean path.

## Finding 4 — "malformed hand-back" has no reliable, unique transcript-level signal

Zero of the 69 real `SubagentHandback` calls were malformed (none missing/empty the
required `message` field), and zero `tool_result` rows tied to a `SubagentHandback`
`tool_use_id` were flagged `is_error`. Structurally: the tool schema requires `message`
as a string parameter, so a call missing it would almost certainly be rejected at the
tool-call-validation layer before ever being persisted as a "call with a missing
field" — producing a generic `is_error` tool_result indistinguishable in shape from any
other tool's error (a bad `Read` path, a failed `Bash` command, etc.), not a
hand-back-specific signature. Combined with Finding 3 (the call is essentially never the
final row anyway, so "final turn contains a hand-back-shaped call" doesn't match the
real shape), there is no way to build the plan's original "Malformed hand-back" scenario
against real evidence rather than a guess.

**Decision (per this step's own instruction): the "Malformed hand-back" Gherkin
scenario and its corresponding Acceptance Criteria bullet are DROPPED, not rescoped.**
Recorded against issue #2188 (epic #2172) — its Gherkin block, Acceptance Criteria
bullet, and Risks & Open Questions entry were revised to match, in the same commit-set
as this file's header.

## Classification precedence (#2188 Step 2.1b — stated explicitly here so two
## implementers can't disagree)

1. Unreadable/missing transcript, or a readable transcript whose last row is
   missing an expected `message`/`content` field entirely (structurally
   malformed, not just "empty") -> fail-open, `"unreadable"`, no event.
2. `message.stop_reason == "max_tokens"` -> `"truncated-final-turn"`. Checked
   BEFORE the empty-content check: a token-limit cutoff can itself produce
   empty/near-empty content (Finding 2 notes no real `max_tokens` example was
   seen, but the Messages API contract still governs it), and `stop_reason` is
   the more specific, intentional signal, so it wins the overlap case.
3. Empty/whitespace-only final assistant content, with `stop_reason` anything
   other than `"max_tokens"` (including the common `null` case, per Finding 2)
   -> `"empty-final-turn"`.
4. Otherwise (including `stop_reason: null` with non-empty content, and
   `stop_reason: "end_turn"`/`"tool_use"` with non-empty content) -> `"clean"`.

No "malformed hand-back" branch: Finding 4 above found no reliable,
uniquely-identifying transcript-level signal for it, and the plan's Gherkin
scenario for it was dropped rather than built against a guess.
