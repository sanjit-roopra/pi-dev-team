"""mcp_json_repowise_nudge — Claude Code SessionStart hook (#1747).

`project-init/SKILL.md`'s `.mcp.json` standing check can only relocate a
stale, git-tracked `repowise` entry when someone actually runs
`/project-init` (or `/setup`). For an already-initialized project, nobody
is prompted to do that — the entry sits untouched indefinitely. This hook
is that proactive nudge, mirroring `pending_review_notify.py`'s /
`repo_review_nudge.py`'s shape: read a small state signal, print a one-line
stdout notice, fail-open, stdlib-only.

Shares its detection predicate — `hooks/lib/mcp_json_repowise.py::detect()`
— with the standing check itself (invoked from skill markdown via that
module's own CLI), so the two can never disagree on what counts as "needs
fixing" (#1747's single-commit requirement: this hook is meaningless
without that module's `relocate()` existing, so the two ship together).

Nudges every session until the condition clears (no snooze/debounce) — same
posture as the existing pending-review-queue and repo-review nudges.

Contract (docs/python-hook-contract.md):
    Input : SessionStart JSON on stdin (hook_event_name, cwd, model, ...).
    Output: notification text on stdout. Exit 0 always.
    Posture: fail-open — a buggy notifier must never block a session; this
        hook only ever suggests, it never gates.

Stdlib-only.
