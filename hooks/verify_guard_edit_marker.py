"""verify_guard_edit_marker.py — PreToolUse hook (#708), sibling of
verify_guard.py.

Matcher: `Write|Edit|NotebookEdit`. Stamps verify_guard.py's per-session
state file to record that a real code edit happened since the last
verify-class Bash command. verify_guard.py reads this flag to tell a
genuinely stuck loop (same verify command, zero intervening edits) apart
from ordinary TDD re-verification (RED, GREEN, REFACTOR each legitimately
re-run the same command, but each preceded by an edit) before escalating
to a hard block.

This hook itself never warns or blocks — it only records a fact for its
sibling to read.

Contract (docs/python-hook-contract.md):
    Input : PreToolUse JSON on stdin (session_id, cwd)
    Output: none
    Exit  : always 0 (silent-pass)
    Env   : TMPDIR

Stdlib-only. See docs/python-hook-contract.md.
