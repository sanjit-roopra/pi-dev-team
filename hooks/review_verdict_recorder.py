"""hooks/review_verdict_recorder.py — SubagentStop per-lens verdict recorder
(#2166, Step 2.3; plan: plans/2164-verdict-ledger-writer.md, Decisions 3/4/4a).

## Contract (docs/python-hook-contract.md)

    Input : SubagentStop JSON on stdin (`transcript_path`, `session_id`, `cwd`)
    Output: zero or more `.claude/metrics/review-verdicts.jsonl` rows via
        `hooks/lib/review_verdicts.emit_review_verdict()` — one per in-scope
        file the dispatch prompt's Step 2.1 scope marker declared, each
        carrying `outcome: "pass"` or `"findings"`. Once `subagent_type` is
        confirmed a registered review lens, a degenerate exit (missing/
        reformatted scope marker, unparseable/malformed final result) also
        writes one `.claude/metrics/boundary-events.jsonl` `"record"`-decision
        row via `hooks/lib/boundary_events.emit_boundary_event()`, naming the
        reason (`missing-scope-marker` | `unparseable-result`) (Fix #3, #2166
        correctness review).
    Posture: fail-open throughout. Any error, or any signal this hook can't
        resolve confidently (missing/unreadable/non-JSON transcript, an
        unresolvable `subagent_type`, an unregistered or registered-but-
        non-review `subagent_type`, a missing/reformatted scope marker, an
        unparseable/malformed final JSON result) -> zero rows written, exit
        0. A per-file read failure (a deleted/unreadable in-scope file)
        skips only that file — the rest still get their rows.

## Spike finding: `attributionAgent` reliability, checked against real
## transcripts before writing the rest of this hook (per this step's own
## instruction — not recalled/assumed)

`hooks/lib/cost_meter.py`'s "Attribution dimensions" docstring claims the
native top-level `attributionAgent` field is "present on every usage-bearing
sidechain record in real transcripts". Checked here directly against every
real subagent transcript from this session
(`~/.claude/projects/-home-user-agentic-dev-team/<session-id>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`,
124 files, 10,795 total rows, 4,279 usage-bearing assistant rows):

  * 124/124 files carried an `attributionAgent` value on 100% (4,279/4,279)
    of their usage-bearing (assistant) records — no exceptions.
  * Exactly one distinct value per file, always — never absent-then-present
    partway through, never two different values in one file. The field
    identifies the whole dispatch, not just one turn.
  * Values are plugin-qualified for this plugin's own agents (e.g.
    `dev-team:structure-review`, `dev-team:correctness-review`,
    `dev-team:software-engineer`) and bare for harness-builtin agent types
    (`general-purpose`, `claude-code-guide`) — `strip_plugin_prefix`
    (`hooks/lib/review_agent_registry.py`) already normalizes exactly this,
    reused below rather than reimplemented.
  * The field is NOT stamped on every record in a subagent transcript — only
    the usage-bearing (assistant) ones. The transcript's first record (the
    dispatch-prompt `user` turn this hook also needs, for the Decision 3
    scope marker) never carries it, confirming as a side effect that "the
    dispatch prompt is the subagent's initial user message" holds in
    practice, not just in the plan's own claim.

**Conclusion: the primary signal is fully reliable in this corpus — no scope
change to this step.** The documented Task/Agent-dispatch-join fallback
(main-thread `tool_use.input.subagent_type` + `toolUseResult.agentId`,
matched against the subagent transcript's own `agentId`, with the parent
transcript path derived from `transcript_path`'s own directory structure) is
still implemented below, per the plan's explicit instruction — but the spike
found no real transcript that ever needed it.
