"""SessionStart hook: notify when the pending-review queue has entries.

Emits a one-line notification when .claude/metrics/pending-review.jsonl has
unreviewed entries. Split off (#1284/#1288) from the retired
session_model_banner.py, whose other two responsibilities (persisting the
session model to `.claude/session-model` and announcing the effort-band
routing table) belonged to the band-to-model resolver system ADR 0026
retired — the harness now resolves `model:`/`effort:` natively, with no
plugin-side banner to keep in sync.

Env seams (TEST-ONLY):
    PENDING_REVIEW_FILE  defaults to <cwd>/.claude/metrics/pending-review.jsonl

Contract (docs/python-hook-contract.md):
    Input : SessionStart JSON on stdin (hook_event_name, cwd, model, ...).
    Output: notification text on stdout. Exit 0 always.
    Posture: fail-open — a buggy notifier must never block a session.

Stdlib-only (json/os/pathlib/sys).

    A finding gains exactly one disposition (`reviewed_at` on approval,
    `rejected_at` on rejection — see feedback-learning/SKILL.md); once either
    is present, its audit trail lives in .claude/metrics/config-changelog.jsonl

    queue to drop disposed entries every SessionStart keeps it bounded to the
    outstanding backlog instead of growing without limit across the life of
    a project. Lines that fail to parse can't be classified either way, so
    they are left untouched — /session-review handles malformed-line
    reporting on its own.
