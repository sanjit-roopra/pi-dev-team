"""Stryker xunit.v3 shim gate — PreToolUse hook (#1083, version-gated #2184).

Stryker.NET **< 5.0.0** cannot observe mutant kills through xunit.v3:
xunit.v3 runs on the Microsoft Testing Platform (MTP) and Stryker's per-test
coverage/kill mapping does not work across it (stryker-net issues 3237/3629/3094).
A run against a real xunit.v3 test project completes but reports a false near-zero
score with almost everything "Survived" — silently, since the initial test run
passes. The fix, on those versions, is a xunit.v2 shim project (see the
stryker-xunit-v2-shim skill).

**Stryker.NET >= 5.0.0 closed this gap** (stryker-net#3752: MTP `perTest`/
`perTestInIsolation` coverage analysis) — `-t mtp` alone now gives a real
per-test score against the real xunit.v3 suite, no shim needed. This gate
detects the installed version via `hooks/mutation_adapters/stryker_net.py`'s
`stryker_net_version()` and silent-passes an xunit.v3 run on >= 5.0.0 rather
than scaffolding a shim or blocking (`_version_exempt()`). An undetermined
version (no `dotnet` on PATH, or unparseable `--version` output) fails closed
to the < 5.0.0 behavior below, with a note in the block body saying so. See
`skills/mutation-testing/references/languages/csharp-stryker-net.md`'s
"Stryker >= 5.0.0" section for the `-t mtp` + `coverage-analysis: perTest` +
`concurrency: 1` recommendation this gate's silent-pass hands off to
(the `concurrency: 1` pin is for the OPEN stryker-net#3832 regression).

On a `dotnet stryker` run that would produce the false score, this gate
**auto-scaffolds the shim and reports what it wrote** (it is not silent), then
blocks the current invocation — a PreToolUse hook cannot change the directory the
in-flight command runs in, so the shim must be run from its own directory as the
next step. It guards the two invocations that produce the false score:

  * `dotnet stryker` in a directory whose test project references xunit.v3
    (project mode bound to v3);
  * `dotnet stryker` at a solution root whose solution contains a xunit.v3 test
    project (solution mode binds to it).

It does NOT scaffold blindly: it runs the scope probe first and refuses when the
sources use v3-only constructs that need manual porting, and it never regenerates
over a shim that already exists. A run launched from a `*.Mutation` xunit.v2 shim
directory passes untouched.

When those constructs are present the block body is the **operator decision
gate** (#1791), not just a file list: `xunit_v3_feature_detector.py` classifies
each construct, `hooks/lib/xunit_v3_operator_gate.py` renders what is blocking
plus the four remediation options (port / exclude / skip / degrade) with their
tradeoffs, and the guard **stays blocked until the operator's choice is
recorded**. That recording is what makes the gate a guarantee rather than hook
stdout an agent may paraphrase or skip: before #1791 the shim could be silently
built, silently declined, or silently degraded, and the operator found out from
a report — if at all. Once recorded, the choice drives the outcome: `exclude`
scaffolds with `--compile-exclude` on the flagged files, `port`/`skip` block
until the sources are clean, `degrade` hands back the no-shim floor command.

    match, a v2 shim run, a non-Stryker command, or a project with no
    xunit.v3 test project at all).
