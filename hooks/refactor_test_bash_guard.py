"""refactor_test_bash_guard.py — PreToolUse hook (Bash), issue #906.

The preventive, Bash-aware half of the tests-frozen-during-refactor
invariant (#813). `refactor_test_freeze_guard.py` blocks Write/Edit at a
test file during a recorded REFACTOR phase, but Bash-driven edits (`sed -i`,
`tee`, shell redirection, `mv`/`cp` onto a target, `python -c` with an
`open(..., "w")`) bypass that guard entirely and were previously only
caught reactively, after the fact, by `refactor_test_revert_guard.py`
(PostToolUse) — which reverts/removes the damage once it has already
landed on disk.

This hook recognizes a conservative library of common file-modifying Bash
shapes (`hooks/refactor-bash-write-patterns.json`), extracts the apparent
write target, and — only when a recorded REFACTOR phase is active AND the
target resolves to a file in the step's `test_files_staged` (or would newly
create a file `test_file_classify.is_test_file()` classifies as a test) —
blocks with exit 2 before the command ever runs.

Ambiguous/unparseable commands (no pattern matches, or the matched target
cannot be confidently resolved) are NEVER blocked: the false-positive budget
favors letting the command through and relying on
`refactor_test_revert_guard.py` as the safety net (defense-in-depth, not a
replacement — see the issue's Non-goals). This is not a general-purpose
shell parser.

Fails OPEN on any internal error, with one audit line in
`.claude/metrics/refactor-freeze.jsonl` (hook="bash-freeze") — a broken
guard must never block work.
