"""agent_dispatch_ledger.py — PreToolUse dispatch-ledger hook (#1461).

Registered in `settings.json`'s existing `PreToolUse` `"Agent|Task"` matcher
(alongside `context_ceiling_guard.py`). Records a `boundary-events.jsonl`
`"record"` event whenever a genuine review-agent dispatch fires, so
`hooks/pre_commit_review.py`'s `.review-passed` gate can later corroborate
that a hash-matching write was backed by real, independent Agent-tool
dispatches — not just a self-computed hash (issue #1461's residual gap; see
`hooks/lib/review_gate_hash.py`'s own docstring for the full account).

On each Agent/Task dispatch, reads `tool_input.subagent_type`. If and only if
it is present in `hooks/lib/review_agent_registry`'s closed set of registered
`agents/*-review.md` stems, records one `"record"` boundary event carrying
that agent name as `matched_rule`, stamped with a `subject_hash` binding this
dispatch to whatever content is under review right now, so a review of one
changeset can't later corroborate an unrelated one (#1461 security review).
Anything not in the closed set — a typo, a non-review team agent, or a
fabricated name — is silently NOT recorded, never written as free text:
matching `boundary_events.py`'s own no-free-text constraint (rule IDs /
closed-vocabulary values only, never arbitrary strings). `"record"` is a new,
fifth-plus decision value: an observation, not a block/warn/bypass/
intervention/revert policy verdict — see `knowledge/telemetry-schema.md` for
its full documentation.

**`subject_hash` selection (#1904 Bug 2b, revised from the original
staged-diff-only stamp):** the staged patch (`review_gate_hash()`) is empty
by definition during a `--since <base>`-scoped `/code-review` run
(`skills/pr/SKILL.md`'s only path to `gh pr create` — its step 1 requires a
CLEAN working tree before that review runs, so nothing is ever staged during
it). Stamping the constant `EMPTY_DIGEST` in that case would be exactly the
Bug 1 hazard `review_gate_hash.py`'s own docstring warns against, AND it
would leave this hook's evidence unable to corroborate
`hooks/pre_pr_review.py`'s gate at all for that mode (that gate always
compares against `branch_diff_gate_hash()`, never the staged-diff hash).
So: when the staged diff is empty, fall back to
`branch_diff_gate_hash(default_base_ref(cwd), cwd)` — the SAME content
domain `hooks/pre_pr_review.py` checks and `skills/code-review/SKILL.md`
step 9 now writes for a `--since <base>`-scoped review — and refuse to stamp
(`None`) rather than fall back to the empty digest a second time. The
ordinary auto-scope path (something IS staged) is unchanged: it still stamps
`review_gate_hash()`, matching step 9's own disclosed "identical only in the
common single-commit-then-PR shape" limitation for that mode.

Fail-open, matching this codebase's own hook convention (and
`emit_boundary_event`'s own fail-open write side): any error here — a
missing/unreadable `agents/` directory, a malformed payload, an exception
from the shared helper — must never block a real Agent dispatch. This hook
always exits 0.

KNOWN RESIDUAL GAP (#1461 security re-review): this module is itself a
directly executable script that reads an attacker-/self-controlled stdin
payload. Anyone with Bash access to this repo can run
`echo '{"tool_name":"Task","tool_input":{"subagent_type":"security-review"},
"cwd":"."}' | python3 hooks/agent_dispatch_ledger.py` (repeated with a second
registered agent stem) and produce two byte-genuine "record" rows, correctly
subject-hash-bound, with NO actual Agent/Task dispatch ever occurring. Locking
down `boundary_events.py`'s CLI (this module's sibling forgery vector) does
not close this one — the forge just moves one file over. Registered agent
names are public filenames, so the registry re-validation in
`review_gate_corroboration.py` does not help either. This is not fixable at
this module's level: it requires the harness itself to supply something a
hand-run process cannot fabricate (a signed dispatch receipt, or a
session/turn-identity check against a live stream the harness — not this
script — controls). Until that exists, this control raises the bar against
an agent that takes an *accidental* self-certification shortcut under
ambiguity (this issue's original, observed failure mode); it is not effective
against a deliberate, adversarial bypass. See
`hooks/pre_commit_review.py`'s module docstring for the matching disclosure
on the read side.

Contract (docs/python-hook-contract.md):
    Input : PreToolUse JSON on stdin (Agent/Task matcher)
    Output: always exit 0 — fail-open, this hook never blocks a dispatch.

Stdlib only. See ADR 0014 / ADR 0015.
