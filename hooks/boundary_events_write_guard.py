"""boundary_events_write_guard.py — Claude Code PreToolUse hook (#2171).

`.claude/metrics/boundary-events.jsonl` is the plugin's boundary-level
accountability ledger (`hooks/lib/boundary_events.py`, #859) — every guard
hook's block/warn/bypass decision is recorded there, and that module's own
docstring states rows must never carry free text (command text, prompt
text, file paths, reasons), only rule IDs from closed vocabularies. A
direct `Write` or `Edit` tool call targeting that file bypasses
`emit_boundary_event()` entirely and could forge or corrupt that record
from inside the session — this hook raises the cost of that forgery the
same way `pre_tool_guard.py` raises it for other sensitive paths, by
blocking a Write/Edit whose `file_path`/`path` resolves to the ledger.

Step 1.1 of plans/2164-verdict-ledger-writer.md added the Write/Edit
path-match guard. Step 1.2 extends this same module to also inspect Bash
`tool_input.command` text for write-shaped commands (redirect, `tee`,
`sed -i`, `cp`/`mv`/`rm`/`truncate`/`dd`, or a write/append/exclusive-mode
Python `open()`) that target the ledger by filename, in any path form —
see `bash_command_writes_to_ledger()` and `_BASH_WRITE_SHAPE_PATTERNS`
below. The hook is registered in `settings.json`'s existing `Write|Edit`
and `Bash` `PreToolUse` matcher groups.

Contract (docs/python-hook-contract.md):
    Input : PreToolUse JSON on stdin — for Write/Edit, `tool_input.file_path`
            or `tool_input.path`, resolved relative to `cwd` when not
            absolute; for Bash, `tool_input.command`
    Output: block message on stdout. The Write/Edit-path message names
            `emit_boundary_event()` (`hooks/lib/boundary_events.py`) as the
            remedy — a Python-only function unreachable from a shell
            command. The Bash-path message instead names the
            `hooks/lib/boundary_events.py` CLI's actual invocable shape
            (`python3 plugins/dev-team/hooks/lib/boundary_events.py --event
            <event> --subject-hash <hash> ...`, #1461) — the message
            interpolates the live `<event>` choice set from
            `boundary_events.cli_event_names()` rather than restating it
            here, so this docstring never drifts the way the message
            itself used to (review finding, #2171). `--event` is a flag
            drawn from a closed `choices` set, not a positional, and most
            events require `--subject-hash`; the CLI cannot construct an
            arbitrary row by design — a genuinely custom row still needs
            `emit_boundary_event()` called from a hook (plan-review-ux
            finding, Step 1.2, corrected by review).
    Exit  : 2 to block, 0 to allow. Fail-open on any exception (malformed
            payload, unreadable cwd, unresolvable repo root) — never raises.

Path matching is lexical only (`os.path.abspath` — `.`/`..` collapsing, no
symlink following): a symlink-escape sandbox is explicitly out of scope
(plan Step 1.1 TEST note) — this guard raises the cost of forgery, it does
not sandbox the filesystem. One narrow exception: `targets_ledger()`
resolves the `cwd` anchor itself via `os.path.realpath` before joining a
relative `file_path` against it (review finding — see `targets_ledger()`'s
own docstring) so that anchor stays symmetric with the ledger side, which
already passes through `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`'s own symlink
resolution via `artifact_paths.resolve_file()`/`project_root()`. Everything
beyond that single anchor — the rest of the joined path, and all Bash
command-text matching below — stays purely lexical, no further symlink
following.

    The `cwd` anchor is realpath'd before the join (review finding): the
