"""pre_pr_review — Claude Code PreToolUse:Bash hook (#1886).

Successor to `hooks/pre_commit_review.py`'s review-corroboration gate.
Design decision (issue #1886, resolved): the gate moves from `git commit` to
`gh pr create` — a branch is now free to accumulate any number of local
commits without paying the review-panel cost at each one; the hard block
fires once, against the branch's FULL diff vs. its base, at PR-creation
time.

WHY A NEW MODULE RATHER THAN REPURPOSING `pre_commit_review.py` IN PLACE
(documenting the choice the issue explicitly left open): `pre_commit_review.py`
grew, across #1461/#1476/#1627/#1763/#1801 and further re-reviews, an enormous
amount of machinery specific to `git commit`'s command shape — per-target
`-C`/`--git-dir`/`--work-tree` resolution, `-a`/pathspec-form-commit detection,
cosmetic-delta carry-forward across re-stages, and a `--no-verify`/`-n`
flag-based bypass. None of that transfers to `gh pr create`, which has no `-C`
equivalent, no pathspec-commit-shaped ambiguity, and no native
`--no-verify`-shaped flag to key a bypass off. Reusing that file's own
git-commit-specific detector/hash pair in place would have meant either
carrying dead complexity forward or performing a much larger, riskier
in-place rewrite than standing up a new, deliberately leaner module that
reuses the SHARED library pieces (`review_gate_hash.py`,
`review_gate_corroboration.py`, `boundary_events.py`, `atomic_state.py`,
`artifact_paths.py`) both hooks depend on. `pre_commit_review.py` itself is
now a documented no-op (see its own module docstring) rather than deleted,
since deleting it would strand the many docs/tests/skills that still name it
in prose describing this exact migration.

WHAT CHANGED, MECHANICALLY, FROM THE COMMIT-TIME GATE:

- **Trigger**: `gh pr create` (`hooks/lib/gh_pr_create_detect.py`) instead of
  `git commit`. Any other Bash command passes through immediately (exit 0).
- **Hash**: `hooks/lib/review_gate_hash.py`'s `branch_diff_gate_hash(base_ref,
  cwd)` — `git diff <base>...HEAD`, the WHOLE branch diff against its
  merge-base with the resolved default branch (`default_base_ref()`) —
  instead of `git diff --cached` (one commit's staged patch).
- **Recency window anchor**: `before_ts` is the CURRENT time at
  `gh pr create` invocation, not a gate file's own mtime (design decision,
  #1886: "anchor to before PR creation"). A multi-commit branch may have been
  reviewed well before its final commit; anchoring on "now" rather than on
  when some earlier `/code-review` run happened to write the gate file means
  the window's only real question is "did genuine, distinct review-agent
  dispatches occur recently, for THIS exact branch-diff content" — not "did
  they happen within `WINDOW_SECONDS` of an arbitrary earlier file write".
- **Gate file**: `.claude/memory/.pr-review-passed` (new; distinct from
  `.claude/memory/.review-passed`, whose only remaining writer/reader is now
  historical prose — see `pre_commit_review.py`'s docstring).
- **Bypass**: `PR_GATE_BYPASS_REASON` (an env var, not a `--no-verify`/`-n`
  command-line flag — `gh pr create` has no such native flag to key off).
  Mirrors #709's pattern for the ORIGINAL commit-time gate: when set to a
  non-empty value, the PR is allowed and the bypass is durably logged to
  `.claude/metrics/gate-bypass-audit.jsonl` (the SAME stream, distinguished
  by `triggeredBy: "PR_GATE_BYPASS_REASON"`); when unset, the ordinary gate
  evaluation applies — there is no separate "you tried to bypass but forgot
  the reason" message, because there is no separate flag to detect trying
  without one.

WHAT DID NOT CHANGE: the underlying corroboration architecture is reused
as-is from `hooks/lib/review_gate_corroboration.py` — >= 1 distinct,
registered review-agent dispatch (or a sanctioned doc-only/single-agent
exemption) recorded in the recency window, live-registry re-validated, with
the same #1763 dispatch-failure veto taking priority over every exemption.
See that module's own docstring for the full account of why this raises the
bar without cryptographically closing #1461's self-certification gap.

`_MIN_DISTINCT_DISPATCHES` was lowered from 2 to 1 (#2147): a single
`/code-review` invocation already dispatches a full multi-agent panel
internally, so requiring a SECOND, separate top-level dispatch on top of
that bought no additional corroboration — it only produced false blocks on
a legitimately-reviewed branch (e.g. a single `--agent <name>` review, or a
session whose panel dispatch shape records fewer ledger rows than a prior
plugin version did). The single-agent exemption event
(`single-agent-review-exempt`) is consequently now redundant with the
ordinary count check for the case it was built for — kept anyway, since it
is a harmless, already-audited alternate path, not because anything still
requires it.

DELIBERATELY DROPPED, not carried forward from `pre_commit_review.py`
(explicit scope decisions, not oversights):

1. **Cosmetic-delta carry-forward** (#1627): existed to stop a whitespace-only
   re-stage from forcing a fresh review-agent dispatch before the NEXT commit.
   That friction was a direct consequence of gating every commit; since this
   gate fires once, at PR-creation time, against the branch's cumulative
   diff, the scenario it existed to relieve no longer arises here.
2. **Multi-target `-C`/`--git-dir`/`--work-tree` resolution** (#1801): a
   `git commit` can retarget which repository it commits to; `gh pr create`
   has no equivalent multi-repository ambiguity — it always targets the
   current repository's configured remote.
3. **`-a`/pathspec-form-commit detection** (#1476): specific to `git commit`
   committing tracked-file changes that were never `git add`-ed; has no
   `gh pr create` analogue (a PR is always opened against whatever is
   already committed to the branch).

CLOSED (#1886 follow-up, extended by #1904 Bug 2b): `skills/code-review/SKILL.md`
step 9 WRITES `.claude/memory/.pr-review-passed` with a hash bound to the
branch diff (`branch_diff_gate_hash(default_base_ref(cwd), cwd)`, via this
module's own `review_gate_hash.py --branch-diff` CLI mode), for an
auto-scoped uncommitted-changes review OR a `--since <base>`-scoped one
that passed — the latter is the shape `/pr`'s own `/code-review --since
"$BASE" --json` call actually takes, the only real path to `gh pr create`.
`review_gate_hash.py`'s sibling `review_gate_hash()` (the staged-diff hash)
is no longer written to any gate file at all — `.review-passed` is retired.
`hooks/agent_dispatch_ledger.py` now stamps a dispatch's `subject_hash` with
this same branch-diff hash whenever nothing is staged (the routine state
during a `--since <base>`-scoped review, since `/pr`'s step 1 requires a
clean working tree first) — closing the mismatch for that shape completely,
since every dispatch during it and step 9's own write agree on one content
domain.

KNOWN RESIDUAL GAP, disclosed rather than silently accepted (narrower than
before #1904, still out of this fix's own scope): for an **auto-scoped
uncommitted-changes** review, `agent_dispatch_ledger.py` still stamps the
staged-diff hash (something IS staged in that mode), which is mathematically
identical to step 9's branch-diff write only in the common
single-commit-then-PR shape (a branch cut from its base, reviewed once while
staged, committed, then a PR opened immediately). On a branch with multiple
separate review-and-commit cycles in THAT mode, the branch-diff hash written
at step 9 won't match an earlier cycle's dispatch `subject_hash`, and this
gate correctly falls through to the "no dispatch found" block on a real
`gh pr create`, requiring a fresh `/code-review` run — a `--since <base>`
re-review now closes cleanly per the paragraph above, or the audited
`PR_GATE_BYPASS_REASON` escape hatch remains available — before it opens.

`gh_pr_create_detect.is_gh_pr_create_command`'s own docstring discloses its
detection gap (no `<shell> -c` unwrapping, no command-substitution
unwrapping, ...) — a much lighter heuristic than
`pre_commit_detect.is_git_commit_command`'s five-round-hardened one; see
that module's own docstring for why that difference is a deliberate,
disclosed scope decision, not an oversight.

      case above, a genuinely empty branch diff, or any other git failure
      `branch_diff_gate_hash()` fails closed to — is refused outright rather
