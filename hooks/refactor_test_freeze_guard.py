"""refactor_test_freeze_guard.py — PreToolUse hook (Write|Edit), issue #813.

Enforces the tests-frozen-during-refactor invariant mechanically: while
`/build` has recorded that the current step is in its REFACTOR phase
(`.claude/memory/build-phase.json`), any Write/Edit targeting a test file is denied
(exit 2, `[BLOCK]` per docs/python-hook-contract.md). A refactor step must
never change a test — the invariant held at zero violations across the
experiment campaigns (Rec 4, docs/experiments/RECOMMENDATIONS.md).

Fails OPEN on any internal error, with one audit line in
`.claude/metrics/refactor-freeze.jsonl` — a broken guard must never block
work.
