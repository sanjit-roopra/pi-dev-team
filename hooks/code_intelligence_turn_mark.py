"""Renamed/generalized from codegraph_turn_mark.py (#594 / #572 Phase 3, #1368).

Claude Code PostToolUse hook. Fires after a tool call completes and
`_tool_family()` recognizes its name as belonging to a supported
code-intelligence tool family — currently `mcp__codegraph__*` ("codegraph")
and `mcp__plugin_repowise_repowise__*` ("repowise"). Writes a sentinel at
`${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}/.claude/code-intelligence-turn-state.json` that
the nudge hook (`code_intelligence_nudge.py`) will consult (Step 2.3) to
suppress its warning for whichever tool family was used during the rest of
the current turn.

`transcript_id`/`count_user_lines` are imported from the shared
`hooks/lib/turn_identity.py` module (falling back to local reimplementations
only if that import fails) so this hook and the nudge hook can never drift
apart on how a "turn" is identified. The same module's `matches_current_turn`
owns the identity-match predicate for both this hook's read-modify-write
merge and the nudge hook's read-side suppression check.

Sentinel schema (Step 2.2 — accumulating `tools_used` list, written to
`.claude/code-intelligence-turn-state.json`):
    { "transcript_id": <string>, "turn_counter": <int>, "tools_used": [<string>, ...] }
    - transcript_id: basename of transcript_path with extension stripped
    - turn_counter:  count of `"type":"user"` lines in the transcript file,
                     scanning only the last 1 MiB so a monotonically growing
                     transcript stays O(1) per fire (same cap the nudge hook
                     applies on its side).
    - tools_used:    families (e.g. "codegraph", "repowise") recognized so
                     far this turn, in first-used order, deduplicated.

Before writing, any existing sentinel is read back. When its transcript_id
and turn_counter match the freshly computed values (same turn), the newly
recognized family is merged into the existing `tools_used` list (deduped,
order preserved); otherwise — new turn, new transcript, or a
missing/legacy/corrupt sentinel — the sentinel is rewritten from scratch
with only the new family. A `tools_used` field that exists but isn't a
list, or a sentinel that fails to parse at all, is treated as an empty list
rather than raised (fail-open on the write side, mirroring the nudge hook's
read-side handling of the same shapes).

Both `transcript_id`/`turn_counter` are computed the same way the nudge hook
recomputes them at PreToolUse time, so a same-turn match accumulates and a
next-turn mismatch (new user message → counter bumps) resets it.

Contract (docs/python-hook-contract.md):
    Input : PostToolUse JSON on stdin
    Output: writes sentinel file; no stdout. Exit 0.
    Posture: fail-open. Any internal error → exit 0; sentinel may not be
             written, the nudge hook will simply emit its (advisory) warning.

Stdlib-only (json/os/pathlib/sys/tempfile). See ADR 0014.
