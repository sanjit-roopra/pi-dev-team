"""boundary_events.py — shared boundary-level telemetry emit helper (#859).

Records the decision process of the plugin's guard hooks (policy-gateway
events, per *Code as Agent Harness* §3.5.1): which hook, on which tool,
decided what, because of which rule. Complements `telemetry.py`
(command/skill/gate invocation counts) and `cost_meter.py` (per-agent
token/cost) as the third, boundary-level channel.

ALWAYS-ON: unlike `telemetry.py`, this stream is not gated by
`DEV_TEAM_TELEMETRY` consent — it is a local-only, rule-IDs-only safety /
accountability record (Ambiguity Log, issue #859). Never write free text:
command text, prompt text, file paths, or reasons must never appear in a
`matched_rule` value — only rule IDs from closed vocabularies.

Fail-open: every exception is swallowed. A full disk, read-only
`.claude/metrics/`, or malformed state must never change the calling
hook's stdout, stderr, or exit code.

Stdlib only. See ADR 0014 / ADR 0015.

    Args:
        cwd: Directory whose `.claude/metrics/` subdirectory receives the

        hook: Emitting hook's module name (e.g. "destructive_guard").

            "record", "dispatch-failure". "record" (#1461) is a non-verdict,
            observational entry — it does not block/warn/bypass/intervene/
            revert anything, it merely notes that a genuine, registered

            review agent failed to return a contract-valid result even after
            one retry. Unlike "record" it is consumed ONLY as NEGATIVE
            evidence, by the gate veto in
            `hooks/lib/review_gate_corroboration.py`/`hooks/pre_pr_review.py`
            (`_dispatch_failure_verdict`, #1763 — carried forward to the

            this originally paired with, `_cosmetic_carry_forward_verdict`,
            was specific to the retired commit-time gate and was deleted in
            #1904), so a forged event can only ever narrow corroboration,
            never widen it. Exclude both from verdict counts; see
            `knowledge/telemetry-schema.md`.
        matched_rule: A rule ID from a closed vocabulary — never free
            text (no command text, prompt text, file paths, or reasons).
        session_id: Optional opaque session ID from the hook payload,
            enabling per-session joins with session-digest.jsonl.
        subject_hash: Optional `review_gate_hash()` value (#1461) binding
            this event to the specific staged-content hash it corroborates
            — not free text (a hex digest carries no path/prompt/reason
            information), but a derived value naming what was reviewed.
            `hooks/lib/review_gate_corroboration.py` requires this to match
            the gate's current hash before treating a "record" or exemption
            event as corroborating evidence, so a genuine dispatch/exemption
            for one diff can't satisfy the gate for a different, unrelated
            one.
        subject_hash_normalized: Optional `normalized_gate_hash()` value
            (#1627) — the same binding, computed over the staged patch after
            doc-hunk and indentation normalization. Lets the gate carry
            corroboration forward across a re-stage that provably changed no
            behavior, without a fresh dispatch whose only purpose is to feed
            the ledger. Like `subject_hash`, a derived digest carrying no
            path/prompt/reason information. Events written before this field
            existed simply never match on the normalized path — the same
            backward-compat posture `subject_hash` itself has.

# its own branch in `_main()`, via `_CLI_AGENT_EVENTS`, not this dict) is
# deliberately NOT a fixed tuple — it carries one piece of caller-supplied,
# per-invocation data (the failed agent's name) as `matched_rule`, which a
# static tuple can't express. This is still safe: the decision value it
# writes ("dispatch-failure") is consumed ONLY as negative evidence, by the
# gate veto in `hooks/lib/review_gate_corroboration.py`/
# `hooks/pre_pr_review.py` (`_dispatch_failure_verdict`, carried forward to
# the PR-time gate by #1886) — never as corroborating evidence for a

# narrow corroboration (cause a false block on a gate that would otherwise

# carry-forward veto this originally paired with,

    exemption can't be replayed for a different, unrelated diff.

    Deliberately NOT a generic `--hook/--tool/--decision/--matched-rule`
    pass-through (see `_CLI_EVENTS`) — `--event` selects one of two fixed
    tuples, or (#1763) `dispatch-failure` (see `_CLI_AGENT_EVENTS`), whose

    result after its single retry, recording that fact as negative evidence

    gate veto (`_dispatch_failure_verdict`, #1763 — carried forward to the
    PR-time gate by #1886). `--subject-hash-normalized` is accepted here for
    call-shape symmetry with `agent_dispatch_ledger.py`'s own `"record"`
    events, but has no current consumer: the cosmetic-delta carry-forward
    lens it fed was specific to the retired commit-time gate and was
    deleted in #1904 (along with `sliced-mode.md`'s own now-removed
    `--subject-hash-normalized` emission — see that file for the #1904
    cleanup). `<name>` must be a
    registered `agents/*-review.md` stem — an unregistered name is silently
    NOT recorded, matching `agent_dispatch_ledger.py`'s own validation
    posture (including the same plugin-prefix normalization,
    `strip_plugin_prefix`).

    Fail-open, same posture as `emit_boundary_event` itself: the emit path
    never raises — a missing `--agent`, a broken registry read, or an
    unregistered name all degrade to a silent no-op (return 0), never an
    exception or a nonzero exit. (Argument-parsing usage errors from
    `argparse` itself — e.g. an unrecognized `--event` value — still exit
    nonzero via `parser.error`, as for any CLI; that is a caller-code bug,
    not a runtime condition this fail-open contract covers.)

    KNOWN RESIDUAL GAP (#1763 security review), disclosed rather than
    silently accepted: this fail-open posture is deliberately safe for
    `"record"` (a lost POSITIVE-evidence write only over-blocks the gate)
    but inverts for `"dispatch-failure"` — a lost NEGATIVE-evidence write
    (a full disk, an unwritable `.claude/metrics/`, a registry read that
    happens to fail exactly at write time, or an unregistered/mistyped
    `--agent` value) means a genuine dispatch failure produces no evidence
    at all, and the gate then evaluates on the other agents' `"record"`s
    alone as if nothing failed. Not fixed here: giving this one event type
    a non-fail-open write path would need a `strict` variant threaded
    through `emit_boundary_event` and a corresponding change to how
    `SKILL.md`/`sliced-mode.md` treat a nonzero exit from this CLI — a
    larger change than this bounded exception's own scope.
