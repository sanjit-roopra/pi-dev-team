"""hooks/lib/pre_commit_doc_classifier.py — the `.review-passed` gate's
doc-only exemption predicate (#1461, extracted from `pre_commit_review.py`
under #1477).

Moved out of `pre_commit_review.py` (which had grown to ~759 lines, mixing
the hook stdin/exit-code contract, git querying, plugin-version resolution,
bypass-audit recording, boundary-event emission, doc-only classification,
and the gate-verdict decision engine all in one file) so that module can
stay to hook-contract plumbing and wiring, with this predicate as its own
independently testable, independently reviewable unit.

Re-derives the doc-only exemption's OWN predicate (#1461 security review)
rather than trusting the claim in the ledger event: `--event doc-only`
(`boundary_events.py`) is written by the SAME untrusted party this gate
exists to constrain, so an unconditional "the event exists, therefore trust
it" check is the classic trust-the-client pattern — nothing previously
verified the exempted diff was actually documentation.

Deliberately a TIGHTER re-implementation of `code-review/SKILL.md`'s
doc-only short-circuit and `skills/code-review/scripts/change_shape.py`'s
`_is_documentation` (built on `hooks/lib/doc_classification.py`'s SHARED
literal tables, but not a lockstep copy of `change_shape.py`'s matching
logic — #1461 second security re-review found the original copy
exploitable): those two only ever ADD a review lens or skip everything on
already-honest input; this function is the sole gate deciding whether a
"record zero dispatch evidence" exemption is honored at all, so it must be
a STRICT SUBSET of what SKILL.md/change_shape.py would call documentation,
never a superset. Concretely: (1) a root-doc EXACT NAME (README, LICENSE,
...) only counts at the repository root (`len(parts) == 1`) AND only when
the stem carries NO extension at all — `license_manager.py` staged at the
repo root must never match merely because its basename starts with
"license", and (#1461 FOURTH security re-review) `license-check` or
`readme-lint` must never match either, despite also being extensionless: an
earlier fix used `stem.startswith(prefix)`, which still admitted any
extensionless name merely beginning with a root-doc prefix. Exact
membership in the doc-root word set is the only form that matches this
comment's own stated intent ("the genuinely extensionless case: LICENSE,
NOTICE, AUTHORS") — a `README.txt`-shaped file is already covered by the
`DOC_EXTENSIONS` branch above, so this branch exists ONLY for those exact
extensionless root docs, nothing glob-shaped; (2) a `docs/` directory
membership alone is NOT sufficient — a doc extension is still required,
since `docs/conf.py` or a doc-site build script is executable code that
happens to live under `docs/`. Path segments are lower-cased once, matching
the stem, so a case-insensitive checkout (`Agents/foo.md`, `.Claude/x.md`)
can't escape the functional-config exclusion below by case alone.
`CORE_FUNCTIONAL_CONFIG_SEGMENTS`'s bare `"agents"` entry already matches
`templates/agents/`, and any other `.../agents/...` path, exactly per
`code-review/SKILL.md`'s literal stated rule — no separate
templates-specific helper is needed. If this rule ever needs to change,
change it here first and only loosen the lens-narrowing siblings to
match — never the reverse.

Stdlib only.
