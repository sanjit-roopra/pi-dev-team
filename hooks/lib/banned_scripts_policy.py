"""banned_scripts_policy — shared policy constants and checkout-shape probe
for the #1755 banned-script hook pair (`scan_bash_command_for_banned_scripts.py`,
`scan_worktree_for_banned_scripts.py`).

Both hooks independently defined identical `BANNED_EXTENSIONS`/
`SCOPED_PREFIX`/`ALLOWED_RELATIVE_PATHS` constants (#1850). This module is
the shared extraction so the policy can't drift between the PreToolUse
command-string scan and the PostToolUse working-tree backstop.

Stdlib-only. See ADR 0014/0015.
