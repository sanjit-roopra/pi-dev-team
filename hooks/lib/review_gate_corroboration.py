"""hooks/lib/review_gate_corroboration.py — fail-CLOSED dispatch-ledger
corroboration reader for the review-corroboration gate (#1461).

Read by `hooks/pre_pr_review.py`'s `.pr-review-passed` gate (#1886) — the
gate's hash-match check alone proves the branch-diff content hasn't changed
since that file was written; it does NOT prove an independent review
actually produced that write (see `hooks/lib/review_gate_hash.py`'s own
docstring for the full account of that residual gap). This module reads
`hooks/agent_dispatch_ledger.py`'s `"record"` events from
`.claude/metrics/boundary-events.jsonl` to corroborate that a hash-matching
write was backed by genuine, recent, distinct review-agent dispatches.
(`hooks/pre_commit_review.py`'s own `.review-passed` gate was this module's
original consumer at #1461; that hook is now a documented no-op — see its
own module docstring — following #1886's PR-time gate migration. This
module's own `evaluate()`/`has_doc_only_exemption()`/
`has_single_agent_exemption()` transferred to the new gate as-is; the
cosmetic-delta carry-forward machinery specific to the old commit-time gate
— `evaluate_cosmetic_carry_forward()`, `distinct_normalized_dispatches()`,
`distinct_review_agent_dispatches()`, `CosmeticCarryForwardEvidence` — was
deleted in #1904 once confirmed to have zero remaining production callers.)

Kept as a separate sibling module rather than folded into
`review_gate_hash.py` (design feedback, #1461): `review_gate_hash.py` is
deliberately minimal — a single pure hash function with no registry or
metrics-stream knowledge. This module's registry-cross-referencing,
metrics-reading responsibility is a different concern and belongs on its own;
each module's docstring names the other so the split stays intentional, not
accidental.

Built on `hooks/lib/metrics_query.py`'s existing generic JSONL
reader/filter (`load_stream` + `filter_entries`) rather than a bespoke
second parser — this repo already has one malformed-line-tolerant reader for
exactly this metrics-directory shape.

FAIL-CLOSED (the deliberate opposite of `hooks/lib/boundary_events.py`'s own
fail-open write side): any inability to prove genuine dispatch happened —
a missing ledger file, an unreadable one, or genuinely no qualifying
entries — is treated the same way a security gate must treat "can't prove
it" — as "didn't happen". `boundary_events.py` fails open on the *write*
side because a broken telemetry write must never block a real tool call;
this module fails closed on the *read* side because a broken/absent
corroboration read must never let an uncorroborated `.review-passed` write
pass the gate. Do not "fix" this asymmetry to match the write side — it is
intentional; see `boundary_events.py`'s own module docstring for its side of
the contrast.

A missing `boundary-events.jsonl` is bucketed as a **read failure**, not as
"genuinely no entries": that stream is written by many always-on guard
hooks (destructive_guard, verify_guard, pre_pr_review, telemetry,
context_ceiling_guard, ...), so in any real session that reaches a `gh pr
create` attempt the file will almost always already exist — its total absence is
itself a signal that hook registration is broken, which is an infra
problem the caller should surface distinctly from "the ledger is fine, it
just has no qualifying dispatches". Malformed *individual* JSON lines are
NOT a read failure here — matching `metrics_query.load_stream`'s own
documented precedent, a single corrupt line is skipped, never fatal, and
every other consumer of that stream relies on the same tolerance. "Unreadable"
covers a ledger file that exists but can't be read as text at all (permission
error, undecodable bytes, or the path is not a regular file).

            new dispatch itself returned a valid result — `record` events
            fire before any result exists, the same property that made the

            re-dispatch's own "record" and its eventual outcome (success:
            nothing new emitted; failure: a fresh dispatch-failure event)
            could therefore see a stale failure as already-superseded. Not
            fixed here: doing so would need a completion signal this
            harness has no way to emit today, and the plan's own adversarial
            review (three rounds) deliberately chose "superseded by ANY
            later record, regardless of age" as this field's semantics —
            narrowing it now would reopen a settled design decision, not
            fix an implementation bug. Disclosed rather than silently
