"""hooks/lib/review_agent_registry.py — shared *-review agent glob discovery (#1461).

Both `scripts/check_review_agent_mcp_tools.py` (MCP tool-grant auditing) and
`hooks/agent_dispatch_ledger.py` (the dispatch-ledger PreToolUse hook, #1461)
need the same closed set of registered review-agent names: every
`agents/*-review.md` file's stem. This module is the single extraction point
so a hook never reaches into `scripts/` — the correct dependency direction is
`scripts/` -> `hooks/lib/`, never the reverse (a hook must be import-safe
without any `scripts/` module on its path).

Stdlib only. See ADR 0014 / ADR 0015.
