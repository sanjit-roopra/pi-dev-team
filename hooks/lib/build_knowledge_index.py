# owner instead of two hand-kept-equal ones. Every marker — at any recursion
# depth — must carry a single-path-segment `references/<name>.md` path (no
# `/` inside `<name>`, matching knowledge_index_paths.CORPUS_REGEX's own
# shape and closing off `../` traversal at the regex level), and every path
# resolves against the ORIGINAL including file's own directory (`root`),
# pinned for every recursive call. A marker inside an already-spliced-in
# reference file is still relative to the top-level file's directory, never
# rebased to the nested target's own directory.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# separator (a POSIX-only `[^/\s]+` would let `references/..\..\outside.md`
# through the regex and rely on the resolve()/containment check below as
