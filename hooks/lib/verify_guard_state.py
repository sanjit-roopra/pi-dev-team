"""Shared per-session state helpers for verify_guard.py and
verify_guard_edit_marker.py (#708).

verify_guard.py (PreToolUse `Bash`) needs to tell a genuinely stuck loop
(the same verify command run over and over with zero intervening code
changes) apart from ordinary TDD re-verification (RED, GREEN, REFACTOR
each legitimately re-run the same command, but each preceded by a real
edit). The two hooks communicate that signal through one JSON state file
per session, keyed identically by both hooks — so this module exists to
make sure "identically" is actually true, rather than two independently
maintained copies of the same hashing/keying logic drifting apart.

State shape (JSON object): ``{"hash": str, "count": int, "edited": bool}``.
``hash`` and ``count`` are verify_guard.py's consecutive-identical-command
counter; ``edited`` is set true by verify_guard_edit_marker.py whenever an
Edit/Write/NotebookEdit tool call is observed, and consumed (reset to
false) by verify_guard.py on its next run.

Stdlib-only. See docs/python-hook-contract.md.
