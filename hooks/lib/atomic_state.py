"""atomic_state — shared atomic-write + cross-OS advisory-lock helpers for hooks.

Several advisory hooks persist tiny per-session/per-project state with a
read-modify-write cycle against a shared on-disk file. Two concurrent
invocations (two Bash tool calls firing close together, or two
sessions/worktrees touching the same repo) can race and lose an update
(#1501). This module centralizes the two primitives that close that race:

- `atomic_write(path, text)` — write via a same-directory tempfile + rename
  so a concurrent reader never observes a torn/partial file.
- `locked_state(path)` — a cross-OS exclusive advisory lock held for the
  full read-modify-write cycle so counters increment exactly once per
  invocation instead of clobbering each other.

The lock idiom (`fcntl.flock` on POSIX, `msvcrt.locking` on Windows,
fail-open when neither is available) started as a copy of
`hooks/code_intelligence_turn_mark.py::_sentinel_lock` — #1888 (below) bounded
the acquire wait here but deliberately left that sibling's blocking wait
alone (a PostToolUse nudge sentinel, not a safety-critical guard verdict), so
the two no longer agree on acquire behavior; only the release-path idiom
still matches. Everything here is fail-open: any I/O or locking failure runs
the critical section unlocked / skips the persist rather than raising —
these are advisory nudges, never gates — unless a caller opts into
`locked_state(path, strict=True)`, in which case the same failure raises
`RuntimeError` instead of running unlocked.

Lock *acquisition* is bounded, not a blocking wait (#1888): a hung sibling
process holding the lock must never leave a caller blocked indefinitely,
since some callers (e.g. `boundary_events.py`, per #1874) sit in front of a
safety-critical guard hook's verdict. `locked_state` polls a non-blocking
acquisition for a bounded total budget and falls through to running the
critical section UNLOCKED once that budget elapses — the same fail-open
posture as every other failure mode here. This bounds contention on an
already-held lock specifically; it does NOT bound a stall inside `open()` on
the lock file itself, or inside a caller's own I/O in the critical section —
a wedged mount can still block there. Every one of these fail-open points is
skippable per call: pass `strict=True` to `locked_state` and the same failure
raises `RuntimeError` instead of running unlocked — for a caller (e.g. a
read-modify-write whose lost update is a correctness bug, not an advisory
nudge) that must never silently proceed without the lock.

A second use case (#1889) reuses `locked_state` for pure append-serialization
rather than read-modify-write: several `.claude/metrics/*.jsonl` telemetry
streams have concurrent writers of their own — sliced-mode code-review's 2-3
parallel slices, `/build`'s wave-parallel fan-out
(`DEV_TEAM_MAX_PARALLEL_BUILDS`), or two sessions/worktrees appending to the
same shared log. Without the lock, two processes' `write()` calls can
interleave mid-line and corrupt the stream for every downstream consumer.
`append_line_locked(path, line)` below is the shared helper for that shape.

The lock file is opened with `O_NOFOLLOW` (where the platform defines it)
and created at mode `0600` (security review, #1889): a pre-planted symlink
at `<path>.lock` would otherwise be followed by a plain `open()`, and a
world/group-writable lock file would let another local user on a shared
host acquire and hold it (an `flock`/`msvcrt.locking` caller needs no write
access to the *data* file to do this — only to the lock file). `O_NOFOLLOW`
makes `open()` fail closed (OSError) on a symlinked lock path, which this
function's existing fail-open contract already turns into an unlocked
critical section — the same outcome as any other lock-open failure.

    into one corrupted line (see module docstring, #1889) — the append-only
    counterpart to `locked_state`'s original read-modify-write use case. The
    lock is what provides this, regardless of how many underlying
    `os.write()` syscalls a single logical `.write()` call happens to
    decompose into (e.g. a line long enough to cross the `BufferedWriter`'s
    internal buffer boundary) — a caller does not need to reason about
    syscall-level atomicity separately.

    `fail_open` (default `True`): OSError from `open()`/`write()` is caught
    *inside* the lock and discarded, matching this repo's fail-open posture
    for advisory telemetry. Pass `fail_open=False` for a caller that needs
    the write failure to propagate instead (e.g. a round-log CLI that must
    crash rather than silently record nothing) — the OSError is still
    caught *inside* the lock (avoiding a caller-raised exception crossing
    the generator's `yield`), just re-raised after the lock releases rather
    than discarded.

    `delay_env_var`, when set and naming a set env var, splits the write into
    two separate `write()` calls with `race_window_delay` between them,
    instead of the usual single call. This is a test-only hook, needed
    because a single small `write()` to an `O_APPEND`-opened file is
    typically atomic with respect to other processes on mainstream local
    filesystems (not independently verified here — no recorded runtime
    probe), so simply sleeping *before* an unsplit write may not force real
    interleaving in a test. The split instead simulates a genuinely
    non-atomic write directly (long enough to cross a write-buffer
    boundary, or a filesystem, e.g. some NFS configurations, that doesn't
    honor `O_APPEND`'s atomicity guarantee) — the actual failure mode the
    lock protects against regardless of whether any given production write
    happens to be single-syscall-atomic on its own. Unset (the default) in
    production: exactly one `.write()` call at this Python API level,

    """Test-only injection point: sleep inside a locked critical section when
    `env_var` names a millisecond delay, widening the race window so a
    concurrency test can deterministically force two invocations to overlap
    rather than relying on timing luck. Unset in production; a bad/missing
    value is a no-op (fail-open). NOT the same implementation as
    `code_intelligence_turn_mark._test_delay` despite the similar shape —
    that sibling still has an uncapped sleep inside its own blocking lock.

    Capped at `_MAX_RACE_WINDOW_DELAY_MS` (security review, #1889): several
    callers now invoke this from inside a held exclusive lock on a shared,
    frequently-hit stream (`append_line_locked`'s `_write_maybe_delayed`), so
    an unbounded value here would let anything that can influence the process
    environment hold that lock for an attacker-chosen duration. Every real
    test uses 60ms; the cap costs them nothing. This bounds one call, not a
    whole critical section — a caller invoking it more than once, or from
    inside a loop, multiplies the total; today's callers all call it exactly
    once per critical section, but that is a property of the call sites,
    not an invariant this function enforces.
