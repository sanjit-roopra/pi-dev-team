"""Operator decision gate for the xunit.v3 / Stryker shim block (#1791).

Detection of the xunit.v3-blocks-Stryker problem already existed in three
places — the ``stryker_xunit_shim_guard.py`` PreToolUse hook,
``xunit_v3_feature_detector.py``, and ``mutation_feasibility_gate.py`` — but
none of it guaranteed the **operator** saw a clear explanation and a set of
choices. The guard printed what it scaffolded and blocked; the detector
classified constructs for a gate that was never wired end-to-end; the
feasibility gate recorded a fixed waiver string. All three are informative
for a report, not a decision point: the operator could discover after a
multi-hour run that the shim was silently built, silently declined, or
silently degraded, and never learn what their options had been.

This module is that decision point. It has two halves, both pure/stdlib:

1. **The question.** :func:`build_question` turns the detector's per-construct
   classification into an :class:`OperatorQuestion` — what is blocking (per
   construct, per file, with coverage impact) plus the four remediation
   options with their tradeoffs. :func:`render_question` renders it for the
   guard's block body and the feasibility gate's ``ask-operator`` payload, so
   both decision points speak with one voice.

2. **The guarantee.** A rendered question is still just text an agent could
   paraphrase or skip. What makes the gate enforceable is that the guard stays
   blocked until the operator's choice is *recorded* — :func:`record_decision`
   writes it, :func:`decision_for` reads it back, and a decision only covers
   the blocker set it was made about (:attr:`OperatorQuestion.fingerprint`),
   so a newly-appeared blocker re-asks instead of riding on a stale answer.

The four options mirror the issue verbatim: ``port`` the flagged files,
``exclude`` them from the shim's compile set, ``skip`` (temporarily
deactivate) just the offending tests, or ``degrade`` to the no-shim floor.

Version scope (#2184): this whole gate is a < 5.0.0 concern.
``stryker_xunit_shim_guard.py`` silent-passes a known >= 5.0.0 install
before ever reaching this module, since ``-t mtp`` +
``coverage-analysis: perTest`` observes kills through xunit.v3 directly on
that version and above (stryker-net#3752) — no shim, no port/exclude/skip
tradeoff, and no degrade fallback to weigh. An undetermined version still
fails closed to this gate.

Audit trail (#1870): the decision store on its own is silent — the same
agent the gate constrains can record its own choice (most plausibly
``exclude``, narrowing mutation coverage) with nothing else in the harness
ever seeing it happen. :func:`record_decision` and :func:`decision_for`
each emit a `boundary_events` entry (a "record"-decision `matched_rule` of
`xunit-v3-shim-decision-record-<choice>` on write, `-honor-<choice>` when a
stored decision is read back and used to drive the guard's outcome), bound
to the question's `fingerprint` as `subject_hash` — the same audit stream
`hooks/pre_commit_review.py`'s dispatch-ledger corroboration is reviewed
from. This does not stop a self-recorded `exclude` from taking effect (the
operator's call is still trusted, per this module's whole design) — it
makes the choice visible to anyone auditing the stream, closing the
"nothing else in the harness ever seeing it happen" gap #1870 raised.

Formerly, ``DEV_TEAM_XUNIT3_SHIM_DECISION_FILE`` let any caller relocate the
decision store at runtime with no audit trail on either the record or honor
path — dropped entirely (#1870): no legitimate caller needs to relocate the
store, so removing the seam closes the unaudited-relocation vector outright
rather than trying to retrofit an audit onto it. The store's location is
always ``artifact_paths.resolve_file(DECISION_CATEGORY, DECISION_FILENAME,
cwd)``.
