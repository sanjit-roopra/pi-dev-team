"""hooks/lib/review_dispatch_ledger.py — shared review-dispatch-ledger reading (#1998).

`review_value_coverage.py` and `contract_failure_report.py` both need the
same denominator: how many times each review agent was actually dispatched.
Both hand-rolled an identical `read_jsonl()` + `dispatch_counts()` pair over
`boundary-events.jsonl`'s `hook == "agent_dispatch_ledger"` / `decision ==
"record"` rows (see `agent_dispatch_ledger.py`) — the predicate "this row IS
a review dispatch" had three homes (the emitter plus two independent
readers) before this module. Per this repo's CLAUDE.md ratchet rule ("a
mechanical finding reported twice becomes a check"), two independent review
agents (arch-review, structure-review; #1998 wave 1) plus a third
(domain-review; #1998 wave 2) flagged the same duplication — this module is
the single extraction point, so a hook never reaches into `scripts/` (the
correct dependency direction is `scripts/` -> `hooks/lib/`, never the
reverse, per `review_agent_registry.py`'s own docstring) and neither reader
re-derives the ledger's wire shape by hand again.

Stdlib only. See ADR 0014 / ADR 0015.
