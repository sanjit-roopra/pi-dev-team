"""hooks/lib/review_gate_normalized_hash.py — normalization-invariant gate
hash for cosmetic-delta carry-forward (#1627).

`review_gate_hash()` hashes the raw staged patch bytes, so ANY re-stage after
the corroborating dispatches — a whitespace fix, a markdown edit alongside
code — voids the evidence and forces fresh dispatches purely to re-satisfy
the gate. Those dispatches review nothing new; they exist only to feed the
ledger. #1623 §2 records 4 of the last ~5 sessions hitting
`dispatch-evidence-different-content`/`stale` blocks this way.

This module computes a SECOND hash, invariant under changes that provably
cannot alter behavior, so `pre_commit_review.py` can carry corroboration
forward across such a re-stage — **without** any exemption event, hook
bypass, or self-asserted claim.

## Why this does not reopen #1461

The exemption is a **property of content, recomputed by the hook itself at
gate time** from `git diff --cached`. It is not a claim written by the gated
party. Contrast the doc-only exemption, which already needed hook-side
re-derivation precisely because the ledger event is a self-assertion
(`pre_commit_doc_classifier.py`'s docstring) — here the re-derivation IS the
mechanism; there is no assertion at all. Ledger events still originate only
from genuine PreToolUse dispatch recording, and the forgery surface named in
`agent_dispatch_ledger.py`'s KNOWN RESIDUAL GAP is unchanged in kind.

Kept as a sibling module rather than folded into `review_gate_hash.py`,
following the `review_gate_corroboration.py` precedent named in the issue:
`review_gate_hash.py` is deliberately a minimal pure hash function with no
doc-classification knowledge, and this module's normalization needs exactly
that knowledge.

## What v1 normalizes — and what it deliberately does not

**Dropped:** hunks whose file is doc-classified, reusing
`pre_commit_doc_classifier.is_doc_only_changeset` per file — the same STRICT
predicate the doc-only exemption uses, including its "functional Claude-config
markdown is never documentation" carve-out. A "cosmetic" edit to `agents/`,
`skills/`, `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, or any other enforcement machinery can
therefore never ride the carry-forward.

**Collapsed:** leading/trailing whitespace on a changed line — but only when
BOTH of the following hold. Each is a place where the obvious rule is
unsound, so each is a hard precondition, not a refinement:

1. **The file's language does not make indentation significant.** In Python,
   YAML, Haskell, and friends, dedenting a line moves it out of its block:

       for x in items:          for x in items:
           total += x               total += x
           return total         return total     # <- different behavior

   Both `return total` lines strip to the same text. Treating that as
   cosmetic would let a genuine control-flow change carry corroboration
   forward. Files with an indentation-significant extension
   (`_INDENT_SIGNIFICANT_EXTENSIONS`) therefore get **byte-exact**
   comparison — no whitespace normalization at all. The default for an
   unknown extension is also byte-exact: an extension this module has never
   heard of is not one it can prove is brace-delimited.

2. **The line carries no quote character** (`"`, `'`, or a backtick).
   Whitespace inside a string literal is data. A multi-line string's
   indentation is part of its value, and `"a  b"` vs `"a b"` is a behavior
   change that would otherwise read as cosmetic. Without language awareness
   the only sound language-agnostic rule is to keep every quote-bearing line
   out of the cosmetic bucket entirely.

Interior whitespace is NEVER collapsed under any circumstances. All of this
errs closed: a Python reindent, or an indentation fix on a quoted line,
simply doesn't get carry-forward — costing one re-dispatch rather than
weakening the gate.

## Unquoted multi-line literal bodies (#1638, #1660, #1661, #1667)

The quote-character rule above is what keeps string DATA out of the cosmetic
bucket — but it only sees quote characters, and a whole family of multi-line
literal forms carries a data body with no quote character on its interior
lines: Ruby's `<<~SQL`, PHP's `<<<TXT`, Perl's `<<EOF`, Lua's `[[ ]]`,
PostgreSQL's `$$ $$`, Go raw strings and JS/TS template literals, C++'s
`R"( )"`, and PHP's inline-HTML region between `?>` and `<?`.
`_heredoc_body_marks` tracks each language's grammars per hunk side
(`_HEREDOC_GRAMMARS`, extension-keyed so PHP's three-angle-bracket form can
never cross-match Ruby/Perl's two-angle-bracket form) and forces every line
between an opener and its closer to byte-exact comparison, bypassing
`_canonical_line`'s collapsible/quote-char rules entirely.

Failing closed here means three things, all load-bearing:

- **An opener with no closer inside the visible hunk side marks every
  remaining line, not just up to end-of-context.** The true close may be
  outside what this hunk shows; the safe assumption is that it hasn't
  closed yet, so nothing after it is eligible for whitespace collapsing.
- **An opener could be invisible entirely** — above the first line this
  function ever sees. `normalized_gate_hash` narrows that gap at the source
  by requesting `--unified=100000` context, so for any realistically-sized
  file every hunk spans start-to-end.
- **That context request is a magic number, so it is checked rather than
  trusted (#1662).** A file longer than the window still yields a hunk that
  does not start at line 1, and an opener above it is invisible — the exact
  hazard the grammars close, reopened silently, and failing OPEN rather than
  closed. `normalize_patch` therefore reads the hunk's declared start lines
  and drops any grammared file's non-line-1 hunk to byte-exact comparison
  instead of believing the context flag did its job.

The same call is bounded in both directions (#1663): an explicit subprocess
timeout on the `git diff`, and a cap on the patch size accepted for
processing. Whole-file context means a one-line edit to a large tracked file
(a `.json` lockfile, a generated fixture) otherwise produces and canonicalizes
that entire file, several in-memory copies deep, synchronously inside a
PreToolUse hook on every commit.

## What the canonical form must contain to bind a subject (#1631 review)

The first draft of this module compared, per file, the flat list of removed
lines against the flat list of added lines, and parsed the patch by
dispatching on line prefixes. An adversarial pass found five distinct
collisions where behaviorally different changesets normalized identically,
each of which let unreviewed content ride a carry-forward. All five are
closed here, and each fix is a hard requirement rather than a refinement:

1. **Hunks are consumed by their declared line counts.** Dispatching on
   `--- `/`+++ ` prefixes while inside a hunk is parser confusion: a REMOVED
   source line beginning `-- ` (a SQL/Lua/Haskell comment) renders as
   `--- ...`, was read as a file header, and silently terminated the hunk —
   so every following line in it, including injected code, vanished from the
   digest. An added line beginning `++ ` did the same via `+++ `. A malformed
   or over-running hunk is a parse failure, and fails closed.

2. **The canonical form is per HUNK, comparing each hunk's whole old side
   against its whole new side, context lines included.** Flat per-file
   removed/added lists carry no position, so inserting the same line at two
   different places in a file — `+audit()` before vs. after a call — produced
   one digest. Context lines are what make an insertion point part of the
   subject. A hunk whose two sides canonicalize identically is the true
   definition of a cosmetic hunk, and only then is it dropped.

3. **The collapse is per hunk, never across hunks.** Whole-file
   removed-equals-added treated a line MOVED between two hunks (a
   `lock.acquire()` relocated across a function) as formatting, because the
   file's removed and added lists matched.

4. **Changes carried entirely by patch metadata are recorded, not skipped.**
   A mode flip (`chmod +x`), a rename, a binary-file replacement, and an
   empty new file all produce a diff with NO hunk body. They were therefore
   invisible: staging one on top of an already-corroborated changeset left
   the digest untouched. The earlier rationale — "a mode change is real, but
   it is carried by the raw-hash lens, which is still evaluated first and
   still authoritative" — does not hold, because this lens runs precisely
   when the raw lens has already rejected. Binary files bind their `index`
   blob SHAs, which is the only content signal a textual diff exposes.

5. **An empty canonical form is never a digest.** `sha256("")` is a CONSTANT
   shared by every fully-cosmetic changeset AND by every dispatch recorded
   while the index was clean — so two review dispatches made before anything
   was staged stamped exactly the value a later mode-only or rename-only
   stage recomputes, satisfying the `>= 2` floor with evidence from agents
   that reviewed nothing. `normalized_gate_hash` returns `None` for an empty
   normalization, exactly as it does for a git failure and for the same
   reason: this lens only means something when two parties independently
   arrive at the same NON-TRIVIAL value.

Fixes 2 and 3 cost some invariance — a whitespace fix close enough to a
reviewed change that git merges their hunks now shifts the digest, and the
carry-forward is lost. That is the correct direction for this trade: a lost
carry-forward costs one re-dispatch, a spurious one admits unreviewed code.

**Deferred to v2:** comment-only stripping. It needs language awareness, and
string literals containing comment markers are a known trap. Gated on the
measured residual gate-block rate from #1624's recidivism metric.

## Fail-closed

Any parse or normalization error returns `None`. `pre_commit_review.py` treats
`None` as "this lens is not decisive" and falls through to today's exact
behavior — never to a pass. Same posture as every other read-side check in
the gate path.

#: are already `frozenset` for the same reason.
#:
#: KNOWN RESIDUAL (restored per #1660 — #1638 replaced the original residual
#: note with the grammar dict, leaving this class recorded nowhere):
#: - A `.php` file's leading inline-HTML region, before the file's FIRST
#:   `<?php`, is not marked: `_PHP_INLINE_HTML` needs a `?>` to open, and
#:   the file itself opens in HTML mode with no such token. Reaching it also
#:   requires a hunk starting at line 1, which the #1662 guard below already
#:   constrains.
#: - `.cs` verbatim strings (`@"..."`) and `.py`-style triple-quoted forms in
#:   other whitespace-insignificant languages have no grammar. Triple-quoted
#:   forms are covered incidentally — their delimiter IS a quote character,
#:   so `_canonical_line` keeps those lines byte-exact — but only on lines
#:   that carry the quote, never on interior lines.
#: - `.xml` was DROPPED from `_WHITESPACE_INSIGNIFICANT_EXTENSIONS` instead
#:   of being given a grammar: element text and CDATA sections are
#:   whitespace-preserving over most of a document, so the fail-closed option
#:   #1660 offers is both cheaper and safer than a grammar that would have to
#:   mark nearly every line anyway.
#:
#: Ruby/Perl's bare `<<` is also their shift/append ("shovel") operator
#: (`arr << item`, `x << 2`), but every real style guide writes that with
#: spaces around it. A heredoc opener has no space before an UNQUOTED
#: delimiter, so the identifier group starting immediately after `<<` (no
#: `\s*`) structurally cannot match the idiomatic spaced operator form.
#: Verified directly: `arr << item` and `x << 2` do not match; only the
#: unidiomatic no-space `arr<<item` would, which costs a rare false-positive
#: carry-forward loss. This is also exactly why #1667's digit-permissive
#: delimiter sits behind a REQUIRED quote: allowing `[0-9]` to lead an
#: unquoted delimiter would make `x << 2` a heredoc opener. Perl's grammar
#: carries two further exceptions, both in the SAFE (over-detection, never
#: under-detection) direction:
#: - A space IS legal (and not deprecated) before a QUOTED delimiter
#:   (`print << "EOF";`), so `.pl`'s regex allows whitespace only when
#:   immediately followed by a quote character — never bare — keeping the
#:   shovel-operator distinction intact while still matching this real
#:   heredoc form.
#: - A backslash-quoted delimiter (`print <<\EOF;`, perlop's no-interpolation
#:   shorthand for `<<'EOF'`) is matched by an optional `\` before the
#:   unquoted alternative. Over-matching an opener costs at most a spurious
#:   carry-forward loss (marking replaces a line with itself, byte-exact,
#:   never creating a collision); missing one is the unsafe direction this
#:   whole grammar exists to close.

    """Return one bool per entry in `lines`: True where the line is inside an
    unquoted heredoc body (or is an unresolved opener's tail — see below),
    and must therefore be compared byte-exact regardless of the
    collapsible/quote-char rules `_canonical_line` otherwise applies.

    Tracks a FIFO queue of pending `(ident, modifier)` pairs, not a single
    one: stacked openers on one line are ordinary idioms (Ruby
    `assert_equal(<<~A, <<~B)`, Perl `print <<A, <<B;`), and their bodies
    close in the same order the openers appeared. Marking only the first of
    several openers — losing the rest to ordinary whitespace collapsing —
    is exactly the hazard this function exists to close, so every opener
    found while the queue is empty is enqueued, not just the first match on
    the line.

    Fails closed on an unmatched opener: if a heredoc opens within `lines`
    but no closing delimiter is found before `lines` ends, every remaining
    line is marked True. The true close may lie outside what this hunk's
    side shows; the safe assumption is that it has not closed yet.
    `normalized_gate_hash` additionally requests full-file diff context (see
    its docstring) so that in real use an opener earlier in the same file is
    always part of the same hunk as any body line it covers — this function
    only needs to reason within one hunk side, never across hunks.

    A line that closes a heredoc is not re-scanned for a new opener of its
    own, because `_line_terminated` reports that the terminator consumed the
    whole line. That is sound only for grammars whose closer IS the entire
    (stripped) line. INLINE grammars (#1660/#1661 — Lua long brackets, SQL
    dollar-quoting, Go/JS backticks, C++ raw strings, PHP inline HTML) have a
    genuinely looser closer, so `_delimited` reports the position just past
    the delimiter and the scan resumes there — the "fresh opener on the
    closer's line" case this docstring previously recorded as a hazard a
    looser grammar would reopen.

    An opener line itself is never marked — evident intent, and it usually
    carries no body content (`sql = <<~SQL`) — only lines strictly after it,
    through and including whatever line closes it. For inline forms the
    opener line is additionally already byte-exact under `_canonical_line`'s
    quote-character rule wherever the delimiter is a quote character.

def normalized_gate_hash(cwd=None, target: str = "--cached") -> str | None:
    """sha256 of the normalized staged patch, or `None` on any failure.

    Uses the same `git_safe_diff.run_safe_git_diff` invocation and the same
    `--no-color --no-ext-diff --no-textconv` pins as `review_gate_hash()`.
    Those flags are not optional here either: a `diff.external` driver would
    otherwise collapse this function's input to empty for every changeset,
    turning the normalized hash into a constant — the same subject-binding
    bypass `review_gate_hash()`'s docstring documents at length.

    Also passes `--unified=100000` (#1638): `_heredoc_body_marks` reasons
    only within one hunk side, never across hunks, so a heredoc opener more
    than the default 3 lines of context above a changed body line would
    otherwise be invisible to it — the exact "opened outside the visible
    hunk" hazard the heredoc handling has to fail closed against. Requesting
    enough context to cover any realistically-sized file makes each file's
    changes arrive as one hunk spanning start to end, so an opener anywhere
    earlier in the file is always part of the same hunk as any body line it
    covers. This is strictly safer than the default, never less: wider
    context only ever MERGES hunks, and a merged hunk whose two sides still
    canonicalize identically was purely formatting regardless of how many
    original hunks it absorbed (see the "costs some invariance, never
    safety" trade already accepted for fixes 2-3 in the module docstring).

    `target` mirrors `review_gate_hash()`'s own `target` parameter:
    `--cached` for an ordinary staged commit. (The `HEAD` shape this
    mirrored, for the `git commit -a`/pathspec form (#1476), was
    `review_gate_hash.py`'s `working_tree_gate_hash()` — deleted in #1904
    once `pre_commit_review.py`, its sole caller, was retired to a no-op.)

    Returns `None` — never a digest of empty input — when git fails, AND
    when the changeset normalizes to nothing at all. Both are the same
    hazard: `sha256("")` is a CONSTANT, shared by every broken-git
    invocation, every fully-cosmetic changeset, and every dispatch recorded
    while the index was still clean. Two review dispatches made before
    anything was staged would otherwise stamp precisely the value a later
    mode-only or rename-only stage recomputes, clearing the `>= 2` floor with
    evidence from agents that reviewed nothing. The whole point of this lens
    is that two parties independently arrive at the same NON-TRIVIAL value.

    A changeset with nothing behavior-bearing left therefore gets no
    carry-forward. It loses nothing real: a wholly doc-classified changeset
    is already served by the doc-only exemption lens, which re-derives its
    own predicate against the actual staged files.
