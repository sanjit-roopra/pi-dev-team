"""Shared reader for `/build`'s active-state record (#2177, slice 1).

`/build` owns `.claude/memory/build-phase.json` (see `skills/build/SKILL.md`):
    {"phase": "<implement|test|refactor|between-steps>", "step": "<N.M>", "written_at": "<ISO8601>",
     "test_files_staged": [], "plan_path": "<repo-relative plan file>"}

This module is the single reader of that record, so the post-compaction
re-injection hook and `/build` agree on one contract (pinned by
`tests/hooks/test_build_state_contract.py`).

"Cleared" means: the file is absent, empty, `{}`, unreadable, malformed, or
lacks a string `phase` AND a string `step`. `/build` clears the record only when
the plan completes. At each step completion it rewrites it as a `between-steps`
record (`phase == BETWEEN_STEPS`, `step` = the next step, same `plan_path`), so a
compaction between steps still restores the plan and next step. Only the
`refactor` phase is enforced by the guards, so the retained record is inert to
them, and an old one is ignored by the same staleness rule below.

A record whose `written_at` is missing/unparseable, or older than
`STALE_AFTER_SECONDS` or more than `FUTURE_SKEW_SECONDS` in the future (shared with `test_file_classify.py`: a crashed `/build`
must not haunt later sessions), is also treated as cleared.

`plan_path` is taken verbatim from the record — never globbed or searched —
and is kept only when it resolves to an existing regular file inside the
project directory; otherwise it is None (phase/step are still returned).

Stdlib only; never raises (fail-open for hook callers).
