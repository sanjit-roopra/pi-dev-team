"""code_intelligence_nudge — Claude Code PreToolUse hook.

Renamed/generalized from codegraph_nudge.py (#593 / #572 Phase 3, #1368)
now that this hook nudges agents toward whichever of CodeGraph, Repowise,
and Graphify are indexed in the project, not CodeGraph alone.
`_detect_present_tools()` reports which of the three are present;
`_compose_message()` composes a single-tool or precedence-ordered
combined message for whichever of those are not already used this turn.

Runs before Read, Grep, Glob tool calls. Single-file Read calls, Grep with
a file `path`, and Glob with a literal `pattern` pass silently.

Contract (docs/python-hook-contract.md):
    Input : PreToolUse JSON on stdin
    Output: warning on stderr when exploration is detected
    Exit  : 0 = allow (silent or warn). 2 = block (careful mode only).

Posture: fail-open. Any internal error → exit 0. The hook is a nudge,
never a gate.

Stdlib-only.
