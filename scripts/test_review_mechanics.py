"""Mechanical pre-phase for `agents/test-review.md` (#2169 Step 2.2).

`test-review.md` (Step 2.1, #2169) annotates each of its own `## Detect`
checks as `[MECHANICAL]` (an explicit per-language detection signature or
grep/threshold rule) or `[JUDGMENT]` (requires semantic reasoning about
intent). This script computes every `[MECHANICAL]` check that is cheap to
run as a script, for one test file at a time, so the agent cites raw counts
instead of re-deriving them in prose:

- tests with no assertion call — `error` (matches test-review.md's Severity
  Anchors table)
- missing `await` on async test bodies (JS/TS/C#/Java) — `warning`
- mocks/stubs created without a reset/clear call, or a same-shaped
  re-instantiation/re-initialization in `[SetUp]`/`[TestInitialize]`/
  `@BeforeEach`/`@BeforeAll`, in the same file — `warning`
- unstubbed clock/RNG/timer access (JS/TS/C#/Java), suppressed when a
  fake-timer/injected-clock marker (`jest.useFakeTimers()`, an injected
  `IClock`/`TimeProvider`, `Clock.fixed`, ...) is present in the same
  file — `warning`
- reflection into private members as primary test strategy (Java/C#/
  Python/JS/TS) — `warning`, NOT promoted to `error` by this migration
- the Tolerated-Deviation Hunt's >=3-artifact consolidation rule, with a
  cheap same-line/adjacent-line ticket-reference qualifier suppressing the
  disabled-test/aged-marker/suppressed-warning categories — `warning`

Test-region boundaries (the `it()`/`test()` call for JS/TS, the annotated
method for C#/Java) are found by depth-counting over a MASKED copy of the
file (`_mask_code`) with string/template/char literals and comments blanked
out first — a stray `)`/`(`/`{`/`}` inside a title, comment, or string body
can no longer early-close a region or drive the balance past EOF. For JS/TS,
the no-assertion and missing-await checks additionally never see the
description-string argument itself — `_js_content_slice` derives a
callback-only CONTENT slice from the boundary-only region, so a title like
`'should render'` or `'awaits the response'` can never satisfy the
assertion/await keyword search on its own words (see `_GATING_CATEGORIES`
below for why this specifically matters: no-assertion is one of the two
categories that sets `mechanicalFail`).

Internal-collaborator-doubling detection is NOT reimplemented here — it is
reused via subprocess against `skills/test-design/scripts/
internal_double_detector.py`, whose own docstring documents `--files` as
the seam built for exactly this kind of caller (the subprocess call itself
goes through an injectable `double_detector_runner` parameter so unit tests
for unrelated checks can stub it out rather than paying real spawn cost).
That detector has no `severity` field; its findings carry a `verdict` of
`"high"`, `"informational"`, or `"advisory"`. Only `verdict == "high"` is
translated here into this script's own `error`-severity finding — never a
literal `severity == "error"` check against the reused script's raw JSON,
since no such field exists there.

Two disclosure gaps are surfaced explicitly rather than failing open to a
plain clean bill:

- `internal_double_detector.py`'s own `analyze()` only scans files under a
  `test`/`tests` path segment — narrower than this repo's own test-file
  conventions (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/`, see
  `knowledge/test-file-indicators.md`). When the analyzed file's path has
  no `test`/`tests` segment, the doubling check never runs for it; this
  script emits a named `internal-collaborator-doubling-out-of-scope`
  finding instead of silently reporting zero doubling findings.
- A subprocess spawn/timeout failure or invalid-JSON response from the
  detector is reported as `internal-collaborator-doubling-unavailable` at
  `warning` severity (raised from `suggestion` — a run that never happened
  must not read the same as a clean pass).

Both gaps also set the top-level `doublingCheckRan: false` key so a
downstream consumer can distinguish "mechanically clean except the doubling
gate, which did not run" from a plain clean bill.

`mechanicalFail` is `true` ONLY when a no-assertion-test finding is present
OR a translated `internal-collaborator-doubling` `error` finding is
present. Every other finding this script emits is `warning`-severity: it is
reported, with counts, but never gates the qualitative pass on its own.

A file this script cannot decode/parse produces a single `parse-failure`
finding (no severity that participates in `mechanicalFail`) and falls
through as mechanically clean — this script never crashes and never
silently drops a file.

This script does NOT own an ambient-API marker table of its own for
`internal_double_detector.py`'s B2-waiver-evidence purpose — that table
(`_AMBIENT_API_MARKERS` in that module) stays there; see the REFACTOR note
at `_CLOCK_RNG_TIMER_MARKERS` below for why this script's own marker table
is a different list, not a duplicate.

The Tolerated-Deviation Hunt (`_check_tolerated_deviation`) runs against
whichever single file the CLI is given, test or non-test — this script's
own per-file CLI shape is unopinionated about which files it's called
with. Step 2.3's actual wiring (`skills/code-review/SKILL.md` step 2b)
calls this script only for test files in scope, so in practice the Hunt
currently sees test files, not the "core-flow, non-test source" scope
`test-review.md`'s prose describes — non-test files get no Phase 0 result
and fall through to that agent's own manual-judgment fallback. Extending
the wiring to also cover non-test core-flow files is a separate change,
tracked at the wiring layer (`test-review.md`'s Hunt section), not here.
