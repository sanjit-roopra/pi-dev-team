"""coverage_discovery_js.py — discover and classify every package in a
JS/TS workspace for multi-project coverage discovery (issue #1759, Slice 3).

Resolves the declared workspace globs — from a root `package.json`'s
`workspaces` field (npm/yarn), `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `packages` list, or
`lerna.json`'s `packages` list, in that precedence order (first present
config wins; no cross-stack merge) — purely against the filesystem
(`pathlib`/`glob`, stdlib only). No package-manager CLI is invoked.

Each resolved package directory (a glob match that is a directory containing
its own `package.json`) is classified via `coverage_config.TestClassification`:
`TEST` when it has both a `test` script and a coverage-capable test-runner
devDependency (`jest`, `vitest`, or `mocha`/`ava` paired with `nyc`/`c8`),
`NOT_TEST` otherwise. Unlike .NET's discovery (Slice 2), there is no
`AMBIGUOUS` case for this stack — JS/TS has no analogue to MSBuild's
conditioned-property-inheritance ambiguity.

**Identity contract.** A package's "path" is its directory, resolved by
matching a workspace glob against the filesystem, expressed relative to
`repo_root` in POSIX form (matching the .NET discovery module's
repo-relative-path convention) — the exact, unmodified string every caller
compares against `included`/`excluded` entries, per `coverage_config`'s
identity contract (no normalization beyond this one POSIX-relative
rendering, which is applied once at resolution time, not per comparison).

**Security hardening.** Every glob-resolved package directory is verified to
stay within the resolved repository root before it is read or classified — a
workspace glob containing `..` can never cause this module to read or
classify a directory outside the repository. Brace expansion (below) happens
*before* that containment check, so an escaping path hidden inside a single
brace alternative (`{apps,../outside}/*`) is refused exactly like a bare
`../outside/*`.

**Brace expansion (issue #1827).** npm, yarn and pnpm all accept shell-style
brace alternations in workspace globs (`apps/{web,api}`), but `pathlib` does
not expand them — it looks for a literal directory named `{web,api}` and
finds nothing. Each declared glob is therefore expanded into its
alternatives here before being resolved. Multiple groups expand as a
cartesian product and nested groups expand recursively, matching the package
managers. An unbalanced brace is a `discovery_error`, never a silent
fallthrough to zero matches.

**Explicit `**` validation (issue #1832).** `**` placement is validated by
inspecting each path component rather than by catching `ValueError` from
`Path.glob`. CPython 3.13+ accepts a non-component `**` and treats it as
`*`, so the exception this module previously relied on is no longer raised
there — which turned a `discovery_error` into a silent empty result.

**Minimal pnpm-workspace.yaml parser.** This module never imports PyYAML
(stdlib-only, ADR 0014/0015) and does not implement general YAML. It
recognizes exactly one documented subset of `packages:` — a top-level,
unindented `packages:` key followed by one or more indented `- 'glob'`
list-item lines. Any other shape (a flow-style array, a block scalar, an
anchor, a scalar value, or no top-level `packages:` key at all) is reported
as `coverage_config.discovery_error(...)` naming the unsupported shape —
never silently treated as `DISCOVERY_NOT_APPLICABLE` or an empty package
list, which would reintroduce this issue's exact silent-exclusion failure
mode one layer down in the parser.

def _classify_package(pkg_dir: Path, root: Path):
    """`TEST` when `pkg_dir`'s `package.json` declares both a `test` script
    and a coverage-capable test-runner devDependency (`jest`, `vitest`, or
    `mocha`/`ava` paired with `nyc`/`c8`); `NOT_TEST` otherwise. No
    `AMBIGUOUS` case for this stack.

    Returns `coverage_config.discovery_error(...)` instead — never
    `NOT_TEST` — when `pkg_dir`'s `package.json` exists but is unreadable or
    fails to parse as a JSON object, or when the manifest file itself
    (resolved, to catch a symlink) escapes `root`. `_resolve_globs_to_rel_paths`
    already guarantees `pkg_dir`'s `package.json` exists as a plain
    containment check on the directory; this re-resolves the manifest FILE
    itself because a symlinked `package.json` inside an already-contained
    directory could still point outside the repository."""
