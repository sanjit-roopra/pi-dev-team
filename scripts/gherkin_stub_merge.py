"""gherkin_stub_merge.py — merge newly-derived step-definition stubs into an
existing step-definition file without clobbering an already-implemented step
(issue #1421).

`gherkin-derive`'s `bdd-runner` mode used to regenerate step-definition stubs
unconditionally on every run, silently discarding any step a human (or
`/build`) had already implemented. This module gives it a safe alternative,
mirroring `gherkin_feature_merge.py`'s read-before-write/merge discipline:
parse the existing file via `scripts/lib/stub_extractors` (one
lexically-aware, brace-balance-bounded extractor per language), skip any
candidate whose step-pattern text already exists there — regardless of
whether that existing binding is pending or already implemented — and append
only genuinely-new candidates as pending stubs after the last existing
binding. An existing binding's body is never rewritten or reordered.

`stub_extractors.parse_existing_steps` refuses to guess a span when a file's
brackets don't lexically balance, or a marker has no attached, boundable
body — reported as one of two structural-error sentinels
(`unbalanced-braces`, `dangling-annotation`, re-exported here), plus
`unsafe-path` at this script's own level for a `--existing` path containing a
`..` component, `malformed-candidates` when the `--candidates` scratch
file itself can't be bounded, `unreadable-candidates` when that file is
missing or can't be read at all, and `unsupported-extension` for an `--ext`
naming no known step-definition language. Every error leaves the existing
file completely untouched.

Stdlib-only. (ADR 0014/0015).

Usage:
    python3 gherkin_stub_merge.py merge --existing <path> --candidates <path> \
        --ext <.js|.ts|.mjs|.cjs|.java|.cs|.go> [--dry-run] [--json]
