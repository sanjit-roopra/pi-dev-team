"""autoship_group.py — deterministic issue grouping for `/dev-team:autoship` (Slice 1).

Groups eligible `autoship:ready` (or `--label`) issues into batches using
four signals, via union-find:

- **Native dependency**: issue A's `blockedBy`/`blocking` field names issue B,
  and B is also in the eligible input set.
- **Shared parent**: two eligible issues name the same non-null `parent`
  issue number.
- **Shared label**: two eligible issues carry any label in common outside
  the `autoship:*` prefix AND outside the configured eligibility label
  itself (every eligible issue carries that label by construction — see
  `is_eligible` — so it can never be a grouping signal on its own,
  regardless of whether it happens to start with `autoship:`).
- **Confirmed-batch override** (Step 4.3): two eligible issues both carry
  `autoship:batch-confirmed` AND each one's `confirmed_batch_members` field
  names the other's issue number — see `has_batch_confirmed_override`.
  Supports partial confirmation of an agent-proposed batch (Step 2c,
  `skills/autoship/SKILL.md`): the signal only fires between two members
  that are both confirmed and both still list each other.

Issues with no signal at all land in `ungrouped`. Any batch larger than
`--max-batch-size` (default 5) is trimmed to its oldest N members; the
overflow members move to `ungrouped` rather than being dropped. The same
union-find design lets each signal be added as its own small,
independently-testable function (see `has_dependency_edge`/
`has_shared_parent`/`has_shared_label`) rather than one growing conditional.

Shares its `gh` fetch, `--input-file` schema validation, and eligibility
filter with `autoship_discover.py` via `autoship_state.fetch_eligible_issues`
— this script requests `blockedBy`/`blocking`/`parent` as `extra_fields` on
top of the base required fields, so a live `gh` call fetches them but an
`--input-file` fixture may omit them entirely (they're optional enrichment,
not required schema). Operates on the FULL eligible pool (no
`--max-issues`-style cap; that stays a downstream script's concern).

Usage:
    autoship_group.py --label autoship:ready
    autoship_group.py --label autoship:ready --input-file fixture.json

Stdlib-only.
