"""Resolve which review lenses apply to a set of changed files (#1516).

Given changed file paths, return the review-agent lenses whose ``Scope:``
declaration matches, ordered cheap-first (non-opus before opus). ``/build``'s
inline review checkpoints call this to avoid dispatching lenses with no
matching surface in the diff (a backend-only diff should not spend tokens on
frontend/UI lenses). ``/code-review`` Step 3 also adopted this resolver
(#1533) — both live call sites now share every rule below, not just the
ones present at #1523.
A ``Scope: always`` lens named in ``NON_EXECUTABLE_SKIP_ELIGIBLE`` is
additionally excluded when every changed file is non-executable
(docs/config/assets/lockfiles, never functional Claude-config markdown —
see ``NON_EXECUTABLE_EXTENSIONS`` and ``doc_classification.is_functional_config``), since
that lens's own Skip clause would otherwise just self-report
``{"status": "skip"}`` at opus, high-effort cost.

Roster source: the **Review Agents** table in ``knowledge/agent-registry.md``
(the curated lens list), minus the shared ``NON_REVIEW_AGENTS`` boundary and
the manifest-governed framework-reactivity agents — see ``MANIFEST_GOVERNED``.

Design: ``parse_scope`` and ``applicable_lenses`` are pure (unit-testable with
a synthetic roster). ``build_review_roster`` and ``_read_lines_from`` are the
I/O boundaries; both fail open (a read error never raises) and both report
the failure in ``warnings`` rather than silently narrowing the result —
``unreadable-registry:<file>`` / ``unreadable-files-from:<path>`` /
``unreadable-added-from:<path>``. An affected *agent* additionally stays
include-biased (``build_review_roster``'s unreadable-agent-file case); an
affected *file list* does not fabricate paths, so its warning is the only
signal that the returned list is short.

# would otherwise create for A08.review-manipulation/A05 detection.
# arch-review's clause is about ADR/module-boundary *absence*, not a
# docs-only diff — a pure-markdown ADR update is exactly the case its own
# `## Detect` section (ADR compliance) exists to catch, so filtering it on

# clause — so a Skip-clause change on `correctness-review` (or a new
# candidate with different semantics) can't silently start/stop being
# filtered with nothing forcing that decision. MAINTENANCE: re-verify
# against the named agent's own Skip clause before adding or keeping a name

# and never consult `change_shape.py`, so without this, correctness-review
# still paid full opus cost on every doc-only `/build` step. The two lists

# accident; `performance-review` is haiku-tier and not this filter's cost
# concern, so it is intentionally absent here.

    only the changed files that are also newly *added* — but **only when the
    caller actually supplies it**. ``added_files=None`` (the default — a
    caller, e.g. ``/build``'s inline checkpoints, that has no change-type data
    to offer) makes an added-only scope behave exactly like a plain glob list,
    matching any changed file. This is deliberately fail-safe in the same
    direction every other gate in this module already leans: ambiguity always
    resolves toward *keeping* a lens, never toward silently dropping one a
    caller never asked to narrow. When that fallback fires (a lens selected
    via an added-only scope with no ``added_files`` supplied), it is recorded
    in ``warnings`` as ``unnarrowed-added-only:<name>`` — the same "never
    silently dropped" transparency the missing-``Scope:`` case already gets,
