"""autoship_queue.py — deterministic dispatch-queue construction for
`/dev-team:autoship` (Slice 2).

Consumes `autoship_group.py`'s stdout shape (`{"batches": [...], "ungrouped":
[...]}`) and produces the round's ordered dispatch queue, capped by
`--max-issues`: each `batches` entry becomes a `"batch"` queue unit (backed
by every member issue number), each `ungrouped` entry becomes a `"solo"`
unit. Units are walked oldest-first — by a batch's oldest (first) member's
`createdAt`, or by the solo issue's own `createdAt` — accumulating a running
total of member-issue count. A unit is admitted into `"queue"` only if
including it does not push the running total over `--max-issues`; otherwise
it is deferred whole into `"deferred"` and the walk continues to the next
unit in order (a later, smaller unit may still fit under the same cap).

This script has no eligibility/fetch concern of its own — it is pure queue
construction over already-produced grouping output, so it never calls `gh`
and never needs `autoship_state.fetch_eligible_issues`. It reuses only
`autoship_state.positive_int_validator` for its own `--max-issues` flag.

Usage:
    autoship_queue.py --max-issues 10 --input-file grouping-output.json
    autoship_group.py --input-file eligible.json | autoship_queue.py --max-issues 10
    # `/dev-team:autoship` itself always uses the --input-file form above, so
    # Step 2b/2c (skills/autoship/SKILL.md) can interpose on the scratch file
    # between the two commands; the piped form remains a supported shortcut
    # for any other caller with no need for that interposition.

Stdlib-only.
