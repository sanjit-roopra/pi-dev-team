     [--memory-dir <path>] [--classify trivial|standard|complex] [--fail-wave]
     [--dispatch-personas]

Flags:
  --resume            Skip phases whose state files already exist in memory-dir.
  --skip-llm          Use stubs for classify() and all LLM dispatch.
  --memory-dir <path> Where to read/write phase state (default: .claude/memory/ relative to CWD).
  --classify <size>   Override classification (trivial|standard|complex). For testing only.
  --fail-wave         Simulate a wave barrier failure (for testing).
  --dispatch-personas Dispatch plan-review personas (for testing).

Exit codes:
  0 = success
  1 = error (no prior state with --resume, wave barrier failure, etc.)
