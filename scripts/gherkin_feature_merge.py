"""gherkin_feature_merge.py — merge newly-derived scenarios into an existing
.feature file without destroying prior content (issue #1420).

`gherkin-derive` used to overwrite `features/<surface>.feature` unconditionally
on every run. This module gives it a safe alternative: read the existing file,
locate the named `Feature:` block, skip any candidate scenario whose title
already exists there (exact match, trimmed), and append only genuinely-new
scenarios after the block's last existing unit — never mid-block, never
rewriting untouched text.

Two failure causes are distinguished by construction, not inferred after the
fact: `feature-not-found` (the named `Feature:` title isn't in the existing
file at all — most likely a human renamed it) and `malformed-feature-block`
(the title is found, but the block's structure can't be bounded — a dangling
`@tag` line with no following `Scenario:`, or a `Scenario Outline:` whose
`Examples:` keyword has no table rows). Both refuse to write rather than
silently corrupting or duplicating content.

Stdlib-only. (ADR 0014/0015).

Usage:
    python3 gherkin_feature_merge.py merge --existing <path> --candidates <path> \
        --feature-title "<title>" [--dry-run] [--json]
    python3 gherkin_feature_merge.py check-stale --existing <path> \
