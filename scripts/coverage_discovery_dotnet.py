"""coverage_discovery_dotnet.py — discover and classify every project in a
.NET solution for multi-project coverage discovery (issue #1759, Slice 2).

Enumerates every project via `dotnet sln <solution> list` and classifies
each `.csproj` using `coverage_config.TestClassification`, checking in
order:

1. An inline `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` `PackageReference` in the `.csproj`
   itself (matched on `Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk"`, case-insensitively
   per NuGet package ID convention, regardless of attribute order or
   whether a `Version` attribute is present — this also covers Central
   Package Management's version-less inline form) -> `TEST`.
2. If absent inline, walk every `Directory.Build.props` from the project's
   directory up to the solution root (inclusive). An **unconditioned** match
   (no `Condition` attribute on the `PackageReference` itself or its
   enclosing `ItemGroup`) -> `TEST`. A match that exists only inside a
   `Condition` -> `AMBIGUOUS` (this script deliberately never evaluates
   MSBuild conditions, matching this repo's stdlib-only,
   no-runner-execution convention already established by
   `coverage_readiness.py`).
3. No match anywhere -> `NOT_TEST`.

**Known, documented limitation.** A `GlobalPackageReference` declared in
`Directory.Packages.props` (MSBuild Central Package Management's other,
zero-inline-reference mechanism, distinct from the `Directory.Build.props`
ancestor walk above) is not walked. A project relying solely on it
classifies `NOT_TEST` — see the plan's Risks section.

**Security hardening.** Every resolved project path is verified to stay
within the resolved repository root before it is read or classified — a
`.sln` entry containing `..` or an absolute path can never cause this
module to read or XML-parse a file outside the repository. Separator
normalization (see `_parse_sln_list_output`, issue #1828) happens before
that check, so a backslash-separated `..\\outside\\Evil.csproj` is refused
like its forward-slash form instead of slipping past as one opaque
filename. Every `.csproj`
and `Directory.Build.props` file is also screened for `<!DOCTYPE`/
`<!ENTITY` declarations before being parsed (entity-expansion hardening) —
neither file legitimately carries either.

The `dotnet` subprocess boundary (`shutil.which("dotnet")` and
`subprocess.run([...])`) is mocked/stubbed in this module's unit tests — no
real .NET SDK is required to run them, keeping this module inside the
required `ci-local.sh`/pre-push pytest gate.

Stdlib-only (ADR 0014/0015).

    **Separator normalization (issue #1828).** `dotnet sln list` echoes the
    separators the `.sln` was authored with, and a Windows-authored solution
    emits backslashes. On POSIX `pathlib` treats `src\\App\\App.csproj` as a
    single opaque filename — `PurePath(...).name` returns the whole string —
    so the `.csproj` is never found and every project in the solution fails
    the "does not exist on disk" check even though the file is present. Since
    most enterprise .NET solutions are Windows-authored and their CI is
    commonly Linux, that made .NET discovery non-functional for them.

    Backslashes are therefore normalized to `/` here, once, at parse time.
    This is deliberately unconditional rather than POSIX-only: it keeps the
    recorded path identity — the string every caller compares against
    `included`/`excluded` entries — byte-identical across platforms, so a
    `coverage-config.json` written on Windows still reconciles on Linux.
    Normalizing before the caller's containment check also keeps the `..`
    traversal guard effective on backslash-separated escapes, which
    previously slipped past it as opaque filenames.

    Accepted limitation: a genuine POSIX filename containing a literal
    backslash would be rewritten. MSBuild solution files always use `\\` as a
    separator, so such a path does not occur in `.sln` output."""
