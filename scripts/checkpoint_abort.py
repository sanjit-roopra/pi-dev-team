"""Abort remaining checkpoint lens dispatch on a cheap-tier blocker (#2168).

``/build``'s inline review checkpoints dispatch review lenses cheap-first
(``select_lenses.py``'s ordering). When a cheap-tier lens already reports an
``error``-severity, ``high``-confidence finding, dispatching the remaining
(opus-tier) lenses for that round is very likely wasted spend — the fix loop
will re-dispatch everything anyway once the cheap-tier finding is addressed.
This module makes that abort decision, plus the small amount of pure
aggregation bookkeeping the checkpoint needs around it.

Three entry points, each reachable from the CLI in ``main`` via ``--mode``
(``abort`` is the default, for backward compatibility):

1. ``decide_abort`` (``--mode abort``, default) — the abort decision itself,
   given the cheap-tier lenses' finding JSON and the checkpoint's full
   ordered lens list.
2. ``compute_round_outcome`` (``--mode outcome``) — a pure function the
   checkpoint's outcome-reporting calls at the end of a round; it is the
   single place that guarantees an aborted round whose deferred lenses never
   re-dispatched cannot report a clean pass.
3. ``merge_findings`` (``--mode merge``) — the one piece of production
   aggregation logic this script ships: dedup-and-append, used both by
   ``/build``'s SKILL.md prose (Step 1.2) when folding re-dispatched
   deferred-lens findings back into a round's finding set, and by this
   module's own fixture equivalence test, so that test exercises real
   shipped code rather than a test-local reimplementation of merging.

# step 6a's floor decides whether an *already-dispatched* fix loop should
# keep iterating (continuing is cheap — the agents already ran), while this
# script decides whether to SKIP dispatching opus-tier lenses at all

# `error`/`warning` severity AND `high`/`medium` confidence keeps a round
# from converging. Suggestion-tier and low-confidence findings are "logged,
# never chased" and must not block. This bar is deliberately looser than
# QUALIFYING_SEVERITY/QUALIFYING_CONFIDENCE above, which is a different bar
# for a different decision (see the comment on those constants) — but it is
# the SAME bar as `is_actionable`'s, so it is imported rather than
# reimplemented as a second local constant pair. A prior local copy here
# (`BLOCKING_SEVERITIES`/`BLOCKING_CONFIDENCES`) compared case-sensitively
# while `is_actionable` lowercases first, so a differently-cased
# `"Error"`/`"High"` finding kept `finding_signature`'s fix loop going while
# this script's `compute_round_outcome` reported the round clean — the two
