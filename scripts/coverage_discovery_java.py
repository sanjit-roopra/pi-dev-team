"""coverage_discovery_java.py — discover and classify every module in a Java
multi-module build for multi-project coverage discovery (issue #1765).

Generalizes the shape landed for .NET solutions (`coverage_discovery_dotnet.py`)
and JS/TS workspaces (`coverage_discovery_js.py`) in #1759/#1822 to the two
JVM multi-module build graphs:

- **Maven** — the root `pom.xml`'s `<modules><module>` list, resolved
  **recursively** through aggregator modules (a module that itself declares
  `<modules>` contributes its own children), with cycle protection so a
  self- or mutually-referential graph terminates.
- **Gradle** — `settings.gradle` / `settings.gradle.kts` `include(...)`
  declarations, translating Gradle's colon-separated project paths (`:a:b`)
  to directory paths (`a/b`). Both the parenthesized (Kotlin DSL) and bare
  (Groovy) call forms are recognized, including a multi-line argument list —
  `include ':app',\n    ':lib'` is a single declaration and yields BOTH
  modules. `includeBuild` (composite builds) and `includeFlat` (sibling-
  directory projects) are separate build graphs and are deliberately out of
  scope; neither is mistaken for `include`.

**Out of scope, named explicitly.** A Gradle subproject whose directory is
remapped in `settings.gradle` (`project(":api").projectDir = file("custom")`)
is not resolved to its remapped location — this module resolves the default
`:a:b` → `a/b` layout only. Because a declared module whose directory is
absent is a hard `discovery_error` (never a silent `NOT_TEST`), such a
remapping surfaces as a loud, actionable error naming the missing path rather
than silently dropping the subproject from coverage accounting.

**Stack precedence (no cross-merge).** When both a root `pom.xml` declaring
`<modules>` and a `settings.gradle*` declaring `include(...)` are present,
Maven wins and Gradle is not consulted — the same "first present config wins"
rule `coverage_discovery_js.py` applies across `package.json#workspaces` →
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` → `lerna.json`.

**No JVM, no build-tool CLI.** Unlike .NET discovery (which shells out to
`dotnet sln list`), this module is a pure static parse, matching the JS/TS
module's filesystem-only approach. Invoking `mvn`/`gradlew` would require a
JVM and network access for plugin resolution and cost tens of seconds on
every measurement — unacceptable for a per-run re-derivation.

**Identity contract.** A module's "path" is its directory, expressed relative
to `repo_root` in POSIX form (matching both existing discovery modules) — the
exact, unmodified string every caller compares against `included`/`excluded`
entries, per `coverage_config`'s identity contract. The POSIX-relative
rendering is applied once at resolution time, never per comparison.

**Classification.** `TEST` when the module has BOTH a test-source directory
(`src/test/java` or `src/test/kotlin`) AND a JUnit/TestNG dependency declared
in its own build file. `AMBIGUOUS` — never silently `NOT_TEST` — when a
test-source directory is present but the test-framework dependency is not
declared in the module's own build file: it may be inherited from a parent
POM's `<dependencyManagement>`/`<dependencies>` or a Gradle `subprojects {}`
block or convention plugin. This module deliberately never evaluates that
inheritance (mirroring the .NET module's refusal to evaluate MSBuild
`Condition` attributes); it reports the ambiguity and lets
`coverage_config.drift_check` force an operator decision. `NOT_TEST` only
when there is no test-source directory at all.

**Security hardening.** Every resolved module directory, every build file
read, and the test-source-directory probe are verified to stay within the
resolved repository root before they are read or classified — a
`<module>../../etc</module>`, an `include(':..:..')`, a symlinked build file,
or a symlinked `src/test/java` can never cause this module to read or stat
outside the repository. An out-of-root entry is reported as an error, never
silently dropped.

Every XML read routes through `coverage_config.read_and_screen_xml`, the
shared `<!DOCTYPE`/`<!ENTITY` entity-expansion screen the .NET stack
introduced (`xml.etree.ElementTree` is explicitly not secure against
maliciously constructed data, and a `pom.xml` never legitimately carries
either declaration). It reads the bytes once and the caller parses THOSE
bytes via `ET.fromstring`, so no path is ever checked and then re-opened.
Gradle build files are read the same way — one read per contained path, never
a resolve-then-reopen pair.

A parsed Gradle project spec is validated against a conservative character
allowlist before any path is built from it: a raw NUL (reachable because
settings files are decoded with `errors="replace"`, which does not replace
U+0000) would otherwise make `Path.resolve()` raise `ValueError` — not
`OSError` — and escape this module's "every failure is a structured
`discovery_error`" contract as an unhandled traceback.
