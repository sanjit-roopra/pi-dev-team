"""Shared plumbing for the code-intelligence MCP tool-grant checks.

Three sibling check scripts consume this module as peers — none is any other's
library:

- ``check_review_agent_mcp_tools.py`` — the 24 read-only ``*-review`` agents, all
  granted the same ``BASE_MCP_TOOLS`` set (#1102).
- ``check_agent_tool_mapping.py`` — the non-review team agents, granted per-tier
  sets built from ``BASE_MCP_TOOLS`` (± ``GET_WHY``) (#1108).
- ``check_security_assessment_mcp_tools.py`` — the security-assessment plugin's
  code-reading agents, granted the same ``BASE_MCP_TOOLS`` set as the review-agent
  check above, but discovered via a named roster rather than a filename glob
  (#1388).

This module owns the canonical tool-name constants and the frontmatter
``tools:``-line parse/fix plumbing all three checks need. The fix helpers take a
caller-supplied ``required`` list so each check can request its own set (the
5-name review/narrow set, or the 6-name rationale set) without duplicating the
merge logic.
