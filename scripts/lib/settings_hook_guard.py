"""Guard against machine-specific paths from graphify's Claude hook (#1367).

`graphify install --project` (via its `claude install` step) appends
PreToolUse hook entries to the target repo's shared, git-tracked
`.claude/settings.json`, using the absolute path to the graphify binary on
the installing machine (e.g. `/Users/alice/.local/bin/graphify`). If that
file is committed, it bakes one developer's home-directory path into the
repo and silently breaks for every other clone/teammate whose graphify
binary lives somewhere else (different username, different install method —
`uv tool`, `pipx`, `--user pip`, ... all resolve to different paths).

This module scans `.claude/settings.json` for any `PreToolUse` hook entry
that invokes graphify via an absolute filesystem path — instead of relying
on PATH — and relocates it into `.claude/settings.local.json` (already
gitignored, personal-machine scope). The scan is unconditional: it fixes a
repo that already carries the pollution from a past install just as well as
one guarding a fresh install, so `/project-init`/`/setup` can run it as a
standing check rather than only wrapping a live installer call.

No upstream flag exists to make `graphify` emit a bare, PATH-resolved
command instead of an absolute path (checked against installed graphify
0.9.8's `_resolve_graphify_exe`): it is a deliberate design choice, to keep
the hook working in environments where the venv Scripts/ directory isn't on
PATH (e.g. the VS Code Codex extension on Windows). Relocation, not an
upstream flag, is therefore the fix.

Stdlib-only, per ADR 0014/0015 (Python for cross-OS scripts).
