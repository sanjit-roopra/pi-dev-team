"""Per-record signal accumulation shared by both session-log extractors
(issue #2044, epic #2040) — the six drifted-furthest accumulator functions
plus one more that does the same job under a different name (`detect_
correction_turn`; the issue's own table names 7 functions while its prose
says "six", the issue is transparent about this discrepancy — the seventh is
the accuracy signal's "was this a correction turn" classifier, drifted right
alongside the other six).

Unlike session_log.discovery/records/classify (slices #2042/#2043), THIS
slice is not behavior-preserving on purpose — see the module-level and
per-function notes below for what changed, in which direction, for which
extractor, and the historical-comparability consequence. A distilled
enumeration also lives in this slice's commit body; this docstring is the
canonical, in-code record of the same decisions.

The four signal classes `/session-review`'s contract defines (docstring of
scripts/session_extract.py, mirrored in
plugins/dev-team/knowledge/telemetry-schema.md's `session-digest.jsonl`
section):

  token      per-session / per-skill / per-subagent / per-model token +
             cost, and the cache-hit ratio.
  rework     failed edits, repeated file edits, retried bash, repeated
             verify-loop runs, permission denials, compaction events.
  accuracy   tool_result is_error counts by tool, failed->retried ratio,
             and user-correction turns.
  utilization which skills/agents were invoked and how often, and which
             registered skills/agents were never observed.

## Per-function reconciliation

- **accumulate_token_signals** (0.10 similarity). The CORE accumulation —
  sum the 4 usage fields into `tokens_total` and `by_model[model]` — is
  identical in effect between the two copies; kept as the shared function,
  matching `extract_session_report.py`'s existing shape exactly (no cost, no
  skill). Cost computation and per-skill attribution are session_extract.py-
  only EXTENSIONS layered on top by that script's own wrapper (pricing/cost
  stays forked per ADR 0036) — not duplicated here.

- **The per-agent CONTEXT_TOKEN bucket (`new_agent_bucket`/
  `merge_agent_buckets`/`finalize_agent_buckets`)** — not one of the 7 named
  functions, but the mechanism #2029 added to `extract_session_report.py`
  ONLY, giving its `by_agent_type` entries real per-agent `context_tokens`/
  `context_per_dispatch` figures. `scripts/session_extract.py` had no
  equivalent — its `by_agent_type` was a bare message-count `Counter`. This
  slice ports the bucket machinery here and switches `session_extract.py`'s
  `by_agent_type` onto it too, so **the maintainer profile gains
  `context_tokens`/`context_per_dispatch`** — the deliberate, expected
  output change issue #2044 calls the "clearest example of why the fork
  costs something."

- **accumulate_skill_agent_signals** (0.19 similarity). session_extract.py's
  copy is a strict superset: it also tracks `active` (the #711 sticky
  skill/agent pointer the correction-turn signal attributes against) and
  reads a legacy `attributionSkill` fallback via a `skill` parameter.
  `extract_session_report.py` has neither concern (no by_skill/by_agent
  correction breakdown in its report shape). The superset function is kept
  as canonical; `extract_session_report.py` calls it with `skill=None` and a
  throwaway `active` dict it never reads back — with `skill=None` the
  legacy-fallback branch never fires, so its own `skills_invoked`/
  `agent_dispatches` accumulation is unchanged (verified by golden diff
  absence on that specific field).

- **track_tool_call** (0.11 similarity) and **classify_tool_result** (0.50).
  Real difference: session_extract.py guards a `tool_use`/`tool_result`
  block's `id`/`tool_use_id` with `isinstance(..., str)` before using it as
  a dict key; extract_session_report.py's pre-#2044 copies did a bare
  `.get(bid, ...)`/dict assignment, which works for any hashable `bid` but
  raises `TypeError` for an unhashable one (a list or dict — a malformed or
  adversarial transcript field). The safer, guarded form is kept as
  canonical; extract_session_report.py gains the guard. No golden diff: the
  corpus's `tool_use`/`tool_result` blocks all carry string ids.

- **track_edit** (0.58) and **track_bash** (0.42), plus the `EDIT_TOOLS`
  constant both need. session_extract.py's copies keyed `verify_edited_since`/
  `last_verify_norm` by `sid` inside a dict that is itself RESET at the top
  of every per-file loop iteration — session-keying inside an already-
  per-file-reset dict is redundant: exactly one `sessionId` ever appears in
  one transcript file (the #1991 bug the sid-keying was originally built to
  prevent — a review panel's siblings sharing their parent's `sessionId` and
  scoring each other's retries — is already fully prevented by the per-file
  reset alone, verified by `tests/repo/test_session_extract_subagents.py::
  test_sibling_agents_running_one_command_are_not_retries`, which stays
  green under this simplification). `extract_session_report.py`'s copies
  already used the simpler flat per-thread dict
  (`{"bash_commands", "last_verify_norm", "edited_since_verify"}`, built by
  `new_thread()` below) with the same per-file-reset discipline. The simpler
  form is kept as canonical (Simplicity First: no observable behavior
  difference on any realistic transcript, confirmed by the golden harness);
  `session_extract.py` drops its `sid`-keyed dicts and adopts `new_thread()`.

- **detect_correction_turn** (0.78 — closest of the seven). Logic identical
  between the two copies; moved verbatim.

## Historical `session-digest.jsonl` comparability

`by_agent_type`'s value shape changes from a bare integer (message count) to
the same bucket-dict shape `extract_session_report.py` already emitted:
`{input_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens, cache_read_input_tokens,
output_tokens, messages, dispatches, context_tokens, context_per_dispatch}`.
Any historical `session-digest.jsonl` row is NOT comparable on
`token.by_agent_type` (and the derived `session-sync` `by_thread` field)
against a row produced after this change — a consumer doing
`by_agent_type[x] == N` or arithmetic on the value breaks. This is the same
shape of jump `session-digest/v2` (#1994) already made once. The formal
schema-version bump (`session-digest/v3`) and any migration/split-on-schema
consumer update is explicitly issue #2045's job, not this slice's — this
slice only flags it, per its own acceptance criteria.
