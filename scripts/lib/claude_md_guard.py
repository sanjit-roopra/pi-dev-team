"""Snapshot/diff/restore guards for tools that touch a project's `CLAUDE.md`.

Two distinct guards live here, for two distinct contracts:

**`run_install_with_guard`** — for `graphify install --project` (#846), which
rewrites the target repo's `CLAUDE.md` to add a `## graphify` section. Its
updater matches the literal `## graphify` header text and replaces everything
between it and the next `##` heading — a known bug can over-delete, removing
pre-existing unrelated content along with the stale graphify section.

1. Snapshot `CLAUDE.md` before running the installer.
2. Diff the snapshot against the post-install file.
3. If any pre-existing line was lost, restore the snapshot and append the
   canonical `## graphify` section text at EOF instead of trusting the
   installer's in-place edit.
4. If nothing was lost, leave the installer's output as-is.

**`run_install_reverting_unexpected_writes`** — general-purpose guard for an
installer that is expected to leave `CLAUDE.md` **completely untouched**: ANY
diff — added or removed lines, even a write followed by the installer itself
raising — is reverted in full. The reverted-or-not outcome and any added
lines are returned separately, so a deletion-only write is never mistaken for
a no-op. Originally written for `repowise init` (#1670 item 3), whose
`## Codebase Intelligence for <project> (Repowise)` write into
`.claude/CLAUDE.md` turned out to be intended, expected behavior, not a bug —
so `project-init/SKILL.md` does not call this function today. Kept as
reviewed, tested infra for a future installer that genuinely needs a
zero-tolerance guard (unlike `run_install_with_guard`'s scoped-section
tolerance above), rather than deleted, since the two guards' contracts are
otherwise easy to conflate and re-deriving this one from scratch later would
repeat work already done once.
