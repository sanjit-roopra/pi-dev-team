"""gherkin_stub_gate.py — fail closed while bdd-runner step definitions are
still pending (issue #1391).

`bdd-runner` mode wires a real native Gherkin parser (cucumber-js, Reqnroll,
cucumber-jvm, godog) and `gherkin-derive/SKILL.md` Step 4 generates **pending**
step-definition stubs so the suite compiles and fails intentionally (red
before green) — that scaffolding step is correct on its own. Choosing
`bdd-runner` mode is a decision to end up with fully executing, Gherkin-bound
tests, not a decision to scaffold placeholders that may or may not get
finished. This script is the completion gate: it greps the step-definition
files for the per-language pending marker and fails, listing every remaining
file:line, when any stub was never filled in.

Per-language pending markers (`gherkin-derive/SKILL.md` Step 4's table,
reused here — not re-derived). The extension -> (language label, markers)
table itself lives in `lib/_bdd_markers.py` (issue #1421 bug 5) — shared with
`lib/stub_extractors/__init__.py`, which needs the same mapping and used to
reach up into this module's `_MARKERS_BY_EXT` via a `sys.path` layer
inversion to get it. C# carries two markers: `PendingStepException`
is Reqnroll's current auto-suggested stub, and `StepIsPending()` is its
deprecated-since-3.3.4 predecessor — still recognized so an older or
not-yet-regenerated stub isn't a false negative
(`knowledge/test-stack-profiles/bdd-frameworks.md`):

| Language | Framework                          | Pending marker(s)                          |
|----------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| JS/TS    | Cucumber.js                         | `this.pending()`                             |
| Java     | Cucumber-JVM                        | `PendingException`                           |
| C#       | Reqnroll (xUnit/NUnit/MSTest)       | `PendingStepException`, `StepIsPending()`    |
| Go       | Godog                                | `godog.ErrPending`                           |

The language for a given step-definition file is resolved from its
extension, matched **case-insensitively** — `.js`/`.ts`/`.mjs`/`.cjs` →
JS/TS, `.java` → Java, `.cs` → C#, `.go` → Go. Files with an unrecognized
extension are skipped (not every file under a step-definitions directory is
necessarily a step-definition file). Vendored/generated trees
(`.git`, `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`, and virtualenv
directories) are pruned during the scan — the same exclusion set
`detect_bdd_convention.py` uses — so a stray dependency tree under a scanned
directory is never walked or grepped — via the shared `_vendored_tree.py`
helper (issue #1420), also used by `detect_bdd_convention.py` and
`gherkin_failure_path_gate.py`.

Stdlib-only. (ADR 0014/0015).
