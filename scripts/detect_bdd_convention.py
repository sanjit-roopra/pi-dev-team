"""detect_bdd_convention.py — detect a target project's BDD convention.

Deterministic probe `/plan` shells to at plan-creation time, reporting
where derived .feature files should land:

    {"signal": "feature-files" | "manifest" | "none",
     "framework": <name or null>,
     "dir": <repo-relative destination or null>}

Precedence: existing .feature files > BDD dependency in a manifest > none.
Detection is conservative — a false negative (no signal, which prompts the
operator) is preferred over a false positive (the wrong directory), so any
ambiguity (multiple unrelated .feature roots) reports "none". Vendored and
generated trees (node_modules/, vendor/, dist/, build/, .git/, virtualenvs)
are never treated as a signal. A common .feature directory is only a signal
when at least one of its path components is a conventional BDD scenario
directory name (see `_CONVENTIONAL_FEATURE_DIR_NAMES`, issue #1462) — the
signal is then the ancestor path up to and including the deepest such
component (not necessarily the full common directory, which may sit deeper
under an incidentally-nested leaf). Otherwise it reports "none", since a
single incidental `.feature` root elsewhere in the repo (e.g. a
narrowly-scoped test fixture directory) is not evidence of a repo-wide
Gherkin convention.

Stdlib-only.

    None when no .feature file exists outside vendored trees, when the

    multiple unrelated roots and root-level orphans (conservative: prompt
    rather than guess) — or when NO component of that common ancestor is a
    conventional BDD scenario directory name (see
    `_CONVENTIONAL_FEATURE_DIR_NAMES`, issue #1462): the only existing
    `.feature` root in a repo is not by itself evidence of a general Gherkin
    convention.

    When a component DOES match (e.g. `features` in `features/checkout`, or
    in `src/test/resources/features`), the signal is the ancestor path up to
    and including the DEEPEST matching component — not necessarily the full
    common directory. This matters when every `.feature` file happens to sit
    under one nested leaf of an otherwise-conventional root (e.g. only
    `features/checkout/*.feature` exists, no sibling directly under
    `features/` itself): the common ancestor is `features/checkout`, whose
    *final* component (`checkout`) isn't conventional, but `features` — a
    real ancestor — is. Checking only the final component would wrongly
    report no signal here. Taking the deepest (not shallowest) matching
    component matters too: for `specs/features`, both `specs` and `features`
    are individually conventional names, but the deepest match (`features`)
    is the one that yields the existing, expected `specs/features`
    destination rather than truncating to the shallower `specs`.
