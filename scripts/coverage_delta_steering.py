"""coverage_delta_steering.py — turn per-Story coverage deltas into a live
Phase-5 steering signal (issue #1790).

Why this exists. `/coverage-delta` already records one snapshot per Story into
`coverage-history.json`, but nothing read that history *during* the phase: a
Pass-1 run kept closing Stories and reporting mutation-kill progress while
line coverage stayed flat at 74.2%, and nobody saw it until the final report —
by which point the phase's whole budget had gone into the wrong layer. This
script is the mid-phase check: after each Story's delta lands, it measures the
movement of the trailing Stories and fails (exit 3) once several consecutive
Stories have moved line coverage by less than the minimum expected per-Story
delta, so `/test-improve` can prompt for a Phase-1 targeting re-check before
spending the next Story.

Movement, per Story snapshot, is the change in `line_pct` since the previous
Story snapshot — or, for the first Story, since the run's
`baseline_line_pct`. A **negative** movement counts as flat: a Story that made
coverage worse is certainly not progress. A snapshot with no comparable
predecessor (no previous Story and no recorded baseline) has movement `None`
and **breaks** the streak rather than extending it — absence of measurement is
not evidence of flatness.

Branch movement is reported alongside but does **not** drive the verdict:
branch coverage is not natively available on every stack (Go), so keying the
gate on it would make the check silently mode-dependent.

Statuses (and exit codes):

- `flat_streak` (3) — `--consecutive` or more trailing Stories each moved less
  than `--min-line-delta`. The caller prompts; this script does not decide
  policy.
- `flat_streak_forming` (0) — the trailing Story moved less than the minimum
  but the streak is still shorter than `--consecutive`. A distinct status
  rather than `ok`, because "not yet a streak" is not "coverage is moving".
- `insufficient_history` (0) — fewer measurable Stories than `--consecutive`,
  or a trailing Story whose movement could not be measured at all, so no
  streak verdict is possible yet.
- `ok` (0) — the trailing Story moved coverage by at least the minimum.
- exit `2` — the history file is missing, unreadable, not JSON, not a JSON
  array, or carries a non-snapshot element; also an out-of-range
  `--consecutive`/`--min-line-delta`. Never reported as an all-clear.
