# Documentation Review

Scope: always
Verify-model: haiku
Verify-effort: medium
<!-- Verification-mode opt-in (#1628): confirming a doc line now matches the
     code it describes is a comparison, not an inference. Already haiku for
     discovery; this drops effort high -> medium for confirmations only.
     Contract: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/verification-mode.md
     (Whole-file load: short shared contract, no anchors). -->
Cites: [adversarial-review-protocol]

Output JSON: per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/review-agent-output-contract.md` (Whole-file load: short, canonical schema).

Status (derive from the highest-severity finding, do not let finding *volume* alone change the tier): `fail` when any finding is `error` (actively misleading — wrong behavior, removed feature still documented) or `warning` (stale, incomplete, or a detached doc comment); `warn` when the only findings are `suggestion`; `pass` when there are no findings. Comment-hygiene / tracker-ID findings are `suggestion` and on their own never raise status above `warn`.
Severity: error=documentation actively misleads (wrong behavior, removed feature still documented); warning=documentation is stale or incomplete; suggestion=docs could be clearer or more complete
Confidence: high=mechanical update (update version, remove reference to deleted thing); medium=content direction clear, exact wording requires context; none=requires human judgment (architectural narrative, ADR decision rationale)

Context needs: project-structure

**No Bash grant — never invoke git yourself (#1734).** This agent's `tools:`
line has no Bash. The orchestrator's `project-structure` dispatch already
includes full files, the directory tree, and (for a diff-scoped review) a
changed-file list with each file's change type. Do not attempt `git diff`/
`git status` to "see what changed" — that call is denied and surfaces as a
spurious tool-error finding instead of a real one.

## Contract precedence

Before asserting that a frontmatter or tool-grant pattern (e.g. an MCP
wildcard grant like `mcp__<server>__*`) is invalid syntax, verify the claim
against `plugins/marketplace-dev/knowledge/agent-contract.json`'s `tools`
field spec — that file is the authoritative external contract for what
Claude Code's own sub-agent frontmatter schema permits. A repo-internal
checker script's expectation-list constant (e.g. `mcp_tool_grants.py`'s
`BASE_MCP_TOOLS`) enforces a narrower convention layered on top of the
contract; it never redefines what the contract allows, and it may be stale.
When the two disagree, the contract wins — never cite a checker script's
constant as proof that a pattern the contract documents is invalid.

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No documentation files found"}` when:

- Target contains no `.md`, `.mdx`, `.txt`, `.rst`, or `.adoc` files and no inline doc comments
- Target is infrastructure-only (CI configs, build scripts) with no associated documentation

## Detect

### README accuracy

- README describes a feature, API, or command that no longer exists in source
- README omits a significant feature or entry point visible in source
- Setup instructions reference files, paths, or commands that do not exist
- Example code in README does not match current API signatures

### API documentation

- Public function/method signatures in source do not match their JSDoc/docstring/XML doc
- Parameter names, types, or return values documented incorrectly
- `@deprecated` tag missing on symbols that have a replacement
- OpenAPI/Swagger spec out of sync with route handlers (missing fields, wrong types)

### Inline comment drift

- Comments describe behavior that the code no longer implements
- `TODO`/`FIXME` comments referencing issues or features that were resolved without removing the comment
- Commented-out code blocks with no explanation retained beyond 5 lines
- Detached doc comment: a doc/JSDoc/docstring block that describes a *different*
  symbol than the one directly below it (e.g. a block describing function B left
  sitting above function A). Severity `warning`.

### Comment hygiene — describe purpose, not issues

Comments must describe *purpose* (the why), not reference tracker items. Flag,
across any language and comment syntax (`//`, `#`, `/* */`, `--`):

- Issue/epic/ticket IDs in comments: `#<digits>`, `[A-Z]{2,}-<digits>`
  (JIRA/ADO/Linear/etc.), or the words epic/ticket/story/issue next to a number
  (e.g. `epic #24`, `JIRA-1187`).
- Severity `suggestion`. `suggestedFix`: rewrite the comment to state intent and
  move the issue reference to the commit message — do not merely delete the
  number; a comment whose only content is a ticket pointer should be replaced by
  one that explains why.
- Do not flag a bare `TODO(#123)`/`FIXME(#123)` marker the team uses as a
  tracked-work convention — that is the resolved-reference rule above, not this.
- Do not flag standards/spec references that merely *look* like tracker IDs:
  `ISO-4217`, `RFC-2119`, `UTF-8`, `WCAG-2`, `PEP-8`, CVE IDs, etc. These name a
  durable external standard, not a work item — judge by meaning, not the regex.

### ADR update triggers

- A new architectural pattern introduced without a corresponding ADR or update to an existing one
- An existing ADR's decision is reversed or significantly modified by the change
- A new significant dependency added without an ADR documenting the rationale

### docs/ directory consistency

- `docs/agent-architecture.md` does not reflect structural changes made in source
- `README.md` workflow section describes a workflow that differs from current implementation
- `docs/agent-architecture.md` references a configuration or governance detail that is no longer current
- Agent or skill files changed without corresponding update to `CLAUDE.md` registry tables

### External claim verification

- When reviewed content asserts specific behavior of an external API, tool, or
  library (version numbers, endpoint behavior, config defaults, documented
  flags), follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/source-verification/SKILL.md`'s
  (Whole-file load: the full extraction/verification procedure, not one
  section) claim-extraction/verification procedure over it. This agent has no
  `Bash`/`Skill`/`WebFetch` grant, so it applies the procedure's heuristic
  categories and its Read/Grep-driven internal-claim verification directly
  (never invoking `../skills/source-verification/scripts/claim_extractor.py`
  as a subprocess) and reports
  an external-tool/spec claim it cannot fetch as `unverifiable` rather than
  guessing at it.
- A claim it reports `contradicted` is `error` (documentation actively
  misleads). A claim it reports `unverifiable` is `warning` (documentation is
  stale or incomplete — no source could confirm it).

`get_why` (recorded decision rationale) is available to check whether stale-looking
code/docs still have a live rationale before flagging staleness.

## Skills

Whole-file load: each linked SKILL.md is loaded in full when invoked.

- [Source Verification](../skills/source-verification/SKILL.md) — invoke for
  the External claim verification checklist above. This agent has no
  `Bash`/`Skill`/`WebFetch` tool grant, so it applies the skill's
  extraction/verification procedure by direct inspection (Read/Grep) rather
  than running `../skills/source-verification/scripts/claim_extractor.py`,
  and reports a claim it cannot
  fetch a source for as `unverifiable`.

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the shared challenger loop in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md` (Whole-file load: the slim shared methodology — The Loop + Output format — read in full), then work these doc-review-specific challenges:

- Did you compare EVERY changed public signature against its doc comment, not just the ones with obvious drift?
- For each "README describes removed feature" finding, did you confirm the feature is actually gone from source (grep), not assume?
- Did you check whether agent/skill changes require a CLAUDE.md registry-table update — a common silent omission?
- Are there new architectural patterns or dependencies with no ADR-trigger finding — a suspicious absence?
- For each finding, did you distinguish a doc that is WRONG (flag) from one that merely differs in style (do not flag)?
- Did you scan every comment (any language/delimiter) for tracker/epic/ticket IDs, and frame the fix as "describe purpose, move the ref to the commit message" rather than just deleting the number?
- For each detached-doc-comment finding, did you confirm the block describes a different symbol than the one directly beneath it?

Append confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.

## Ignore

Code correctness, naming conventions, test quality (handled by other agents)
Doc style preferences (sentence case vs title case, oxford comma) — flag only when docs are wrong, not when they differ in style
