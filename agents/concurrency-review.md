# Concurrency Review

Scope: always
Cites: [adversarial-review-protocol]

Output JSON: per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/review-agent-output-contract.md` (Whole-file load: short, canonical schema).

Status: pass=no concurrency issues, warn=potential concerns, fail=likely race conditions or safety violations
Severity: error=race condition or data corruption risk, warning=potential concurrency concern, suggestion=defensive improvement
Confidence: high=mechanical pattern fix (add await, add finally); medium=fix direction clear but requires understanding shared state; none=requires human judgment (architectural concurrency design)

Context needs: full-file

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No concurrency-relevant patterns in target"}` when:

- No concurrency-relevant patterns present:
  - JS/TS: no `async/await`, `Promise`, `Worker`, or `SharedArrayBuffer`
  - C#: no `async/await`, `Task`, `Thread`, `Parallel`, `lock`, or `ConcurrentCollection`
  - Java: no `Thread`, `ExecutorService`, `CompletableFuture`, `synchronized`, `volatile`, or `java.util.concurrent`
- No shared mutable state across callbacks, event handlers, or concurrent paths
- Pure synchronous single-threaded code with no event-driven patterns

## Detect

Race conditions:

- Read-then-write without atomicity (check-then-act)
- Shared mutable state accessed from multiple async paths
- Event handlers modifying shared state without guards
- Database read-modify-write without transactions or optimistic locking
- File operations without locking (open-write-close races)

Idempotency:

- Non-idempotent HTTP handlers (POST/PUT without deduplication)
- Side effects in retry-able operations (payments, emails, queue messages)
- Missing idempotency keys on critical mutations

Async/concurrent task pitfalls:

- Unhandled rejections/exceptions:
  - JS/TS: missing `.catch()` or `try/catch` on `await`
  - C#: unawaited `Task` with no `.ContinueWith` error handler; `async void` methods
  - Java: unhandled `CompletableFuture` without `.exceptionally()` or `.handle()`
- Dangling async operations (fire-and-forget without intent):
  - JS/TS: async calls without `await`
  - C#: `Task` not awaited and not stored
  - Java: `CompletableFuture` not awaited and not stored
- Parallel task failures swallowing errors:
  - JS/TS: `Promise.all` — one rejection cancels all without individual error handling
  - C#: `Task.WhenAll` — exceptions from individual tasks swallowed unless explicitly checked
  - Java: `CompletableFuture.allOf` — individual failures require explicit `.exceptionally()` per stage
- Sequential operations that could be parallel:
  - JS/TS: sequential `await` calls with no dependency between them (use `Promise.all`)
  - C#: sequential `await` calls with no dependency (use `Task.WhenAll`)
  - Java: sequential `get()` calls with no dependency (use `CompletableFuture.allOf`)
- Iteration not awaited:
  - JS/TS: `async` callback in `forEach` (does not await iterations; use `for...of`)
  - C#: `async` lambda in `List.ForEach` (fire-and-forget; use `foreach` + `await`)
  - Java: `async`-like operations inside `stream().forEach` without joining

Shared state safety:

- Module-level mutable state in server code (request-scoped data in module scope)
- Global caches without eviction or size bounds
- Mutable singletons accessed across requests
- Closure-captured mutable variables in concurrent callbacks

Resource ordering:

- Nested locks or resource acquisition in inconsistent order (deadlock risk)
- Connection pool exhaustion from unawaited async operations
- Missing cleanup in error paths (finally/dispose)

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the shared challenger loop in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md` (Whole-file load: the slim shared methodology — The Loop + Output format — read in full), then work these concurrency-review-specific challenges:

- Did you trace EVERY shared-mutable-state access across all async paths, or stop at the first guard you saw?
- For each race-condition finding, did you confirm the two accesses can actually interleave (same instance, concurrent entry), not just look risky?
- Is there async code (Promise/Task/Thread) with zero concurrency findings — a suspicious absence to justify or fill?
- Did you check error-path cleanup (finally/dispose) AND unhandled rejection on every awaited call?
- For each "should be parallel" suggestion, did you verify the awaits are genuinely independent (no data dependency)?

Append confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.

## Ignore

Code style, naming, domain modeling, security, complexity (handled by other agents)
