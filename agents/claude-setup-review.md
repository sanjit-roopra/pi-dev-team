# Claude Setup Review

Scope: on-demand
Cites:
- adversarial-review-protocol
- directory-enumeration
Enforcement: script

Dispatched by the user-invocable `/claude-setup-review` command and by the
whole-tree `/repo-review` command (#1735), never by `/code-review`'s
automatic panel. This agent reviews the **harness** (CLAUDE.md, rules,
skills, agent frontmatter), not the changeset, so it has nothing to say
about a diff: under the old `Scope: always` it joined an 18-lens panel for a
two-file JS change in a project with no Claude config at all.
`select_lenses.py`'s resolver reads this `Scope: on-demand` declaration
directly and never selects it for the per-diff roster — the agent body is
the single source of truth for this exclusion, same as any other `Scope:`
kind.

> **Implemented by:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/claude_setup_review.py`
> — a deterministic validator, so prefer running it over re-deriving its checks
> by reading files. It was previously named as a bare `scripts/…` path while
> living only at this repository's root, so for anyone who installed the plugin
> the reference resolved nowhere and the agent silently degraded to a pure-LLM
> pass.

Output JSON: per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/review-agent-output-contract.md` (Whole-file load: short, canonical schema).

Status: pass=complete config, warn=gaps, fail=critical missing
Severity: error=blocks AI effectiveness or violates required schema; warning=reduces quality or uses unsupported field; suggestion=enhancement or style improvement
Confidence: high=mechanical fix (add missing field, fix invalid value); medium=content exists but needs restructuring; none=requires human judgment

Context needs: project-structure

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "Not a Claude Code project"}` when:

- No CLAUDE.md, `.claude/` directory, agent files, or `.clinerules` file exists
- Target is clearly not a Claude Code-enabled project

Check existence with `Glob` only — e.g. `Glob("CLAUDE.md")`, `Glob(".claude/**")`, `Glob("**/agents/*.md")`, `Glob(".clinerules")`. Never `Read` a directory path (the repo root, `.claude/`, `agents/`) to see what it contains — `Read` on a directory fails with `EISDIR`. `Read` only specific files `Glob` has confirmed exist. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/directory-enumeration.md` for the shared rule (Whole-file load: a short single-rule reference).

## Detect — CLAUDE.md

- Missing or malformed
- No project overview
- No architecture documentation
- Undocumented directory structure
- Missing/incorrect commands
- Missing coding conventions
- Referenced paths don't exist

Rules:

- Missing .clinerules or .claude/rules/
- Rules not actionable
- Conflicting rules

Skills:

- Common workflows (commit, test, deploy) not defined as skills
- Missing skill definitions
- Skills reference wrong paths/commands

Accuracy:

- Documented structure doesn't match actual project
- Commands don't work

## Detect — Agent frontmatter schema

Apply to every `.md` file found in `agents/` directories within the target — enumerate them with `Glob("**/agents/*.md")`, never by `Read`ing the directory (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/directory-enumeration.md` — Whole-file load: a short single-rule reference). Check against the official Claude Code sub-agent specification.

### Required fields

- **`name`** — must be present; must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens only, starting with a letter). Flag missing `name` as error. Flag names containing uppercase, spaces, or special characters as error.
- **`description`** — must be present and non-empty. Flag missing or empty `description` as error.

### Optional fields with constrained values

Check these only when present:

- **`model`** — must be one of: `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, `inherit`, or a recognized full Claude model ID (pattern: `claude-[a-z]+-[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)*(-[0-9]+)?`). Flag any other value as error.
- **`memory`** — must be one of: `user`, `project`, `local`. Flag any other value as error.
- **`background`** — must be `true` or `false`. Flag any other value as error.
- **`effort`** — must be one of: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. Flag any other value as error.
- **`isolation`** — must be `worktree`. Flag any other value as error.
- **`color`** — must be one of: `red`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `purple`, `orange`, `pink`, `cyan`. Flag any other value as error.
- **`maxTurns`** — must be a positive integer. Flag non-integer values as error.

### Plugin-unsupported fields

Flag as **warning** (not error) when present in an agent file that ships as part of a plugin (i.e., lives in a plugin's `agents/` directory):

- **`hooks`** — silently ignored for plugin agents; has no effect
- **`mcpServers`** — silently ignored for plugin agents; has no effect
- **`permissionMode`** — silently ignored for plugin agents; has no effect

Suggested fix for each: "This field is ignored for plugin agents. Move the agent file to `.claude/agents/` or `~/.claude/agents/` if you need this field to take effect."

### `tools` field guidance

- Flag as **suggestion** if `Skill` appears in `tools` AND the agent appears to use skills for context-loading rather than runtime invocation: "Consider using the `skills` frontmatter field to preload skill content at startup instead of listing `Skill` in tools. Use `Skill` in tools when the agent needs to invoke skills dynamically at runtime."
- Do not flag `Skill` in tools as an error — it is a valid tool name for runtime skill invocation.

### Unknown frontmatter fields

Flag as **suggestion** any top-level frontmatter key that is not in the official field list (`name`, `description`, `tools`, `disallowedTools`, `model`, `permissionMode`, `maxTurns`, `skills`, `mcpServers`, `hooks`, `memory`, `background`, `effort`, `isolation`, `color`, `initialPrompt`). These fields are ignored by Claude Code and may indicate a typo or a skill field accidentally placed in an agent file.

## Quality Checks (LLM reasoning scope)

The script handles all mechanical checks. LLM reasoning is reserved for quality
judgments that require contextual understanding:

- Coverage of all `.md` files under `agents/` — not just a sample
- Path references resolved against the actual tree, not assumed
- Required-field violations (error) vs. plugin-unsupported fields (warning) distinguished correctly
- Unknown frontmatter keys flagged as suggestions
- Commands verified against the actual manifest (package.json/Makefile), not inferred from name

The `summary` field should include a confidence level (High/Medium/Low).

## Ignore

Code quality, tests, domain modeling (handled by other agents). Agent body content (system prompt quality) is out of scope for this agent.
