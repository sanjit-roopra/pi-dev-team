# Correctness Review

Scope: always
Cites:
- adversarial-review-protocol
- agent-review-methodology

Output JSON: per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/review-agent-output-contract.md` (Whole-file load: short, canonical schema).

**Status** (derive from the highest-severity finding, do not let finding volume alone change the tier):

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pass` | Implementation matches evident intent everywhere reviewed |
| `warn` | One or more suspected divergences that need human confirmation, or an unverified runtime/library claim (category 6) reported with no observed defect |
| `fail` | A clear behavioral defect where the code visibly contradicts its own name/comment/sibling logic |

**Severity**:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `error` | The implementation will silently produce the wrong result on a realistic input path (missing assignment, non-interpolated string, missing guard, dropped boundary case, inverted condition) |
| `warning` | The divergence is plausible but the evident intent is inferred rather than explicitly stated |
| `suggestion` | A minor mismatch between docstring/name and behavior with no observed defect, or a category 6 (unverified runtime/library claim) finding — always capped at `suggestion` since no defect is being asserted, only missing evidence |

**Confidence**:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `high` | The evident intent is explicit (a docstring, comment, sibling branch, or unambiguous name) and the code visibly fails to satisfy it |
| `medium` | The evident intent is inferred from context (naming pattern, surrounding structure) rather than stated outright |
| `none` | Not used for a finding *about reviewed content* — a finding with no articulable evident intent is dropped, not reported (see Detect preamble below). **Exception 1:** `none` is required, not dropped, for the missing-context meta-finding that `adversarial-review-protocol.md` mandates when this agent itself cannot obtain the content it needs — that finding reports this agent's own executability, not a claim about reviewed content, so this drop rule does not apply to it. **Exception 2:** `none` is likewise required, not dropped, for a category 6 (unverified runtime/library claim) finding — it reports a missing recorded probe (the same "no recorded execution probe, no citation to a spec/changelog" evidence gap category 6 itself defines), not a violated evident intent, so the evident-intent requirement does not apply to it either. |

Context needs: full-file

Before a raw whole-file `Read`, check whether a code-intelligence index is
available and prefer it for obtaining that full-file context:
`mcp__codegraph__*` (CodeGraph, when `.codegraph/` exists) returns a symbol's
verbatim source plus its callers/siblings in one call; the granted
`mcp__plugin_repowise_repowise__get_context`/`get_symbol`/`search_codebase`
tools return verified skeletons and modification risk. Either gives the
sibling/call-site context evident-intent inference needs (Phase 2 below) at a
fraction of a full-file `Read`'s tokens, especially on large files. See
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/codegraph-vs-graphify.md` for the full
comparison. Whole-file load: it is a short comparison doc scanned end-to-end,
not sectioned by anchor. **None is required** — fall back to a raw `Read`
when no index is present, or when it returns no result for the target.

## What This Agent Checks

This agent answers one question: **does this code do what it evidently intends to do?** It infers intent from the code itself — the function's name, its docstring/comments, its sibling branches, and its call sites — not from an external spec (that is `spec-compliance-review`'s job, comparing code against a written spec). It does not evaluate structure, security-specific bypass patterns, naming style, or test quality. Every other review agent's lens is code *quality*; this agent's lens is: is the code's own evident promise kept?

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No behavioral logic to analyze"}` when:

- Target contains only static assets, configuration, markup, or documentation with no executable logic
- Target is generated code, vendored dependencies, or lockfiles

## Protocol

Run the shared three-phase methodology in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/agent-review-methodology.md` (Whole-file load:
the Enumerate/Classify/Group phases and their rationale, read in full) —
enumerate first, classify second, group third.

**Phase 1 — Enumerate**: Walk the full diff/file(s) under review and list
every candidate divergence against the seven Detect categories below —
assignments that look stale, conditionals that look inverted, guards that
look missing, runtime/library claims with no recorded probe, documented
error/return contracts that aren't honored, and so on — without yet deciding
severity or confidence.

**Phase 2 — Classify**: For each candidate, first identify the evident
intent (the specific name, docstring, comment, sibling branch, or call site
establishing what the code is supposed to do). If none exists, drop the
candidate entirely — see the Detect preamble below (category 6 is the one
exception: it is evidence-only by design and is never dropped for lacking an
evident intent). Otherwise assign severity and confidence per the table
above.

**Phase 3 — Group**: Report at the granularity of distinct defects, not one
finding per line touched. When the same evident-intent violation recurs
across near-identical sites (e.g. the same missing guard copy-pasted into
three call sites), a single finding listing the sites beats three
near-duplicate findings — but never fold genuinely distinct defects
(different evident intent, different category) into one finding.

## Severity Anchors

Calibrate against these worked examples before flagging real code:

| Severity | Code / Claim | Violation | Evident intent |
|---|---|---|---|
| `error` | A loop inside `calculateAverage` accumulates into `total`, but the running-sum reassignment line is missing, so the loop body no-ops and the same initial value returns every call | Missing assignment: the sum the function's own name requires is never accumulated | Function name `calculateAverage` |
| `error` | `` `Failed to load ${moduleName}: reason` `` — `reason` reads as a variable but is a literal | Literal-vs-interpolation: the rest of the string interpolates, this one token doesn't | The string's own mixed interpolation pattern |
| `error` | Docstring says "raises `ValueError` on malformed input"; the function instead catches the parse error internally and returns `None` | Error-signalling divergence: the documented failure mode is silently swallowed, callers checking for the exception never see it | Docstring's own "raises" line |
| `error` | `for (i = 0; i <= items.length; i++)` against a comment stating "0-indexed, valid range is 0 to length-1" | Boundary/off-by-one: the `<=` reads one index past the last valid index the comment defines, out-of-bounds on the final iteration | Adjacent comment stating the valid range |
| `warning` | `if (!isValid && !force) throw new ValidationError()` — `force` was added later with no docstring update saying whether bypass is intended | Inverted/extra clause: `force` may silently loosen validation, but nothing states outright that it must never be exempted — the intent is inferred from the docstring's silence, not stated explicitly | Docstring's silence on the new clause, inferred rather than explicit |
| `suggestion` | A comment asserts a helper `chunk()` "runs in O(n)", with no benchmark or citation recorded nearby | Unverified runtime/library claim (category 6): flags the missing evidence, not a defect — always capped at `suggestion`, per #1629's executable-claims convention | No evident intent violated — flagged for missing evidence, not a correctness defect |

## Detect

Work through the file(s) under review looking for these seven categories,
following the Protocol above. For every candidate, first identify the
"evident intent" — the specific name, docstring, comment, sibling branch, or
call site that establishes what the code is supposed to do — before treating
it as a finding. **If you cannot articulate that evident intent concretely,
the candidate is out of scope for this agent — drop it entirely.** Do not
downgrade it to `confidence: none` and report it as noise; a correctness
finding with no articulable intent is not a correctness finding. **Exception:
category 6** (unverified runtime/library claims) is evidence-only by
design — it reports a missing recorded probe, not a violated evident
intent — so this drop rule does not apply to it; report it at
`confidence: none` and `severity: suggestion` instead.

1. **Missing/incomplete assignment** — a variable is declared, or reused
   from an outer scope, but never (re)assigned the value that the
   surrounding logic clearly requires before it's read. Look for: a loop
   or block that reads a variable which should have been reassigned from a
   lookup/computation immediately above it, but the assignment line is
   absent (the value is stale, `undefined`, or from an unrelated prior
   iteration). Grep for the variable's declaration and every write site;
   if a read has no preceding write on the path that reaches it, flag it.

2. **Literal-vs-interpolation errors** — a string clearly intended as a
   template/format string (it contains `${...}`-shaped placeholders,
   `%s`-style tokens, or string concatenation everywhere else in the same
   function) but a specific placeholder is written as a literal character
   sequence instead of the interpolation syntax the language requires
   (e.g., `` `foo?${bar}` `` where `foo` should also have been
   interpolated, `"literal_var"` where `f"{var}"`/`${var}` was clearly
   intended). The signal is inconsistency: some parts of the string
   interpolate, one part doesn't, and the un-interpolated part reads as a
   variable name or expression.

3. **Missing guard/validation branch** — a function's own name, docstring,
   or sibling functions imply a precondition or exclusion case (e.g., "is
   cacheable", "validate", "sanitize", "guard") that the function's body
   does not actually check before proceeding. Look for functions that
   perform an effectful operation (write, cache, mutate) where a sibling
   function or comment establishes a condition under which that operation
   should NOT happen, but no corresponding `if`/early-return enforces it.
   This category covers a precondition the function never checks at
   all — contrast with category 7, which requires a check or branch that
   *does* run.

   **Named sub-case — missing degenerate-input guard at function entry** —
   for a parsing or validation function whose docstring/name implies
   a class of degenerate inputs (empty string, a single character, a bare
   sign, whitespace-only) is invalid, check specifically whether a guard
   rejecting that class exists at the *top* of the function, before the
   main parsing logic runs. A function that correctly handles the general
   case can still let a degenerate input fall through to an unguarded
   library call (e.g. a bare non-digit character reaching a numeric parser
   uncaught) — check function entry explicitly, don't infer safety from the
   general-case logic being otherwise correct.

4. **Boundary-condition / off-by-one omission** — a numeric, length, or
   index comparison that correctly handles the documented general case
   but silently drops an edge case that a comment, adjacent constant, or
   sibling comparison implies should also be handled (classic: a
   `>=`/`>` or `<=`/`<` that should include an equal-length or
   sign/overflow boundary; a loop bound off by one relative to the
   collection it iterates; a digit-count check that omits the sign-bit or
   most-significant-digit case).

5. **Inverted or incomplete conditionals** — an `if`/`while`/ternary
   condition whose polarity or coverage contradicts the behavior implied
   by the surrounding code, comment, or the branch bodies themselves (a
   comment says "skip when X" but the code proceeds when X; an early
   return guards the wrong branch; an `else` handles what the `if`'s own
   name implies it should have handled). This is the general case —
   `security-review` owns the security-specific subset (auth-bypass
   conditionals); do not re-flag findings that are purely
   security-relevant here if `security-review` would already cover them,
   but do flag general-purpose inverted logic with no security angle.

   **Named sub-case — extra or missing boolean clause in a validation
   condition** — when a docstring/comment states a validation rule in
   terms of specific conditions ("X is valid only when...", "Y is never
   acceptable"), compare the condition's actual clauses one-by-one against
   that stated rule — not just its overall pass/fail behavior on an obvious
   input. An *extra* clause can silently loosen a rejection (e.g. a stated
   "never acceptable" case gets exempted by an added `&& value != <case>`),
   and a *missing* clause can silently loosen an acceptance rule the same
   way. The defect is easy to miss because the condition still reads as
   plausible validation logic — it's wrong only relative to the specific
   rule stated elsewhere, so the comparison must be clause-by-clause against
   that stated rule, not a general plausibility check of the condition.

6. **Unverified runtime/library claim** — a comment or docstring asserts a
   specific runtime or standard-library behavior ("this call is O(n²)",
   "this method mutates its receiver", "the receiver must be an Object or
   it throws", "this sort is stable") that nothing in the file shows was
   actually verified — no recorded execution probe, no citation to a
   spec/changelog. Per #1629's executable-claims convention, **flag that
   the claim carries no recorded probe — do not adjudicate whether the
   claim itself is true or false.** This agent's tool grant is read-only
   (no execution capability — see its frontmatter `tools:` line), so
   judging the claim directly would be a guess dressed up as a finding.
   Report the claim's location and quote it; leave the correctness verdict
   to a human, or to a probe recorded elsewhere in the file. This category
   is evidence-only — see the exception in the Detect preamble above and
   the Confidence table's second exception. When the claim sits in a file
   whose authorship looks AI-generated, defer to `ai-provenance-review`'s
   verification-debt lens instead of double-reporting the same gap.

7. **Error-signalling divergence** — a docstring or comment states that a
   function raises/throws a specific exception, or returns a specific
   sentinel/documented value on a given branch, but a branch the code
   actually evaluates doesn't honor that contract: the exception is caught
   internally and swallowed (a default is returned instead), or a branch
   that IS reached returns something other than its documented value, or
   returns nothing at all despite executing that branch's body. Distinct
   from category 3 (missing guard/validation), which covers a precondition
   the function never checks in the first place — this category requires
   a check or branch that *does* run, whose result is then signalled
   wrongly. Distinct from `doc-review`'s comment-drift lens: this category
   owns the case where the code's behavior is wrong relative to a
   documented error/return contract the code itself evidently intends to
   honor (fix the code); `doc-review` owns the case where the
   documentation is merely stale relative to already-correct behavior (fix
   the doc). When the intended direction is genuinely ambiguous, use
   `confidence: medium` and say which artifact you believe is
   authoritative.

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the shared challenger loop in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md` (Whole-file load: the slim shared
methodology — The Loop + Output format — read in full), then work this
correctness-review-specific challenge before finalizing each finding:

- For every candidate finding, can you cite the *specific* docstring line,
  comment, sibling function/branch, or unambiguous name that establishes the
  evident intended behavior being violated? Quote it in the `message` (the
  Detect preamble's drop-if-no-articulable-intent rule already governs
  whether the finding exists at all — this challenge is about the citation's
  specificity).
- For a category 7 candidate, did you confirm the branch that mishandles
  the documented contract is actually reached/evaluated, rather than the
  precondition simply never being checked (that's category 3, not 7)? If a
  `doc-review` finding on the same lines is equally plausible, did you state
  which artifact — the code or the docs — you believe is authoritative?
- Did you check that the finding isn't better explained as intentional
  (e.g., a guard the caller already performs, a boundary the type system
  already rules out)? If genuinely ambiguous, use `confidence: medium` and
  say what would confirm it, rather than `high`.
- Did you trace the actual data flow (declaration → assignment sites → read
  sites) for "missing assignment" findings, rather than assuming a variable
  is stale from its name alone?
- For "missing guard" findings, did you confirm the guard is truly absent
  on every path that reaches the effectful operation, not just the one you
  read first?

Append confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.

## Ignore

Code style and naming (`naming-review`), structure/DRY/coupling
(`structure-review`), security-specific logic bypass such as auth-bypass
conditionals (`security-review`), test quality (`test-review`),
business-boundary/DDD placement (`domain-review`), spec-to-code matching
against an explicit written spec (`spec-compliance-review`), refactoring
opportunities (`refactor-opportunity-review`), documentation that is merely
stale relative to already-correct behavior (`doc-review` — see category 7's
own deference clause for the discriminator when both could apply).
