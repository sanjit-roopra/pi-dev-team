# Spec Compliance Review

Scope: always
Cites:
- adversarial-review-protocol
- directory-enumeration

Context needs: full-file
File scope: All changed files

## What This Agent Checks

This agent answers one question: **does the code do what the spec says?** It runs as the first gate before quality review agents. If spec compliance fails, there's no point checking code quality.

## Detection Patterns

### Unmet acceptance criteria

- Read acceptance criteria from the spec (`docs/specs/<slug>.md`), plan, and/or design doc — or, on a repo that opted into `/specs`' issue-first persistence convention, from the linked spec GitHub issue if the plan records a `--spec-issue <url>` reference instead of a `docs/specs/**` file (see `/specs`' "Persist to GitHub issue" step)
- For each criterion, locate the implementation that satisfies it
- For each criterion, locate the test that validates it
- Flag criteria with no implementation or no test

### Uncovered scenarios

- Read the per-slice Gherkin scenarios from the plan (or any `.feature` files, if the project keeps them)
- For each scenario, locate the corresponding test
- Flag scenarios with no test or with a test that doesn't match the scenario steps

### Scope violations

- Identify code changes not traceable to any acceptance criterion
- Flag unrequested features, refactoring, or behavior changes beyond spec

### Plan deviation

- Compare the implementation to the plan's file-change list
- Flag files modified that aren't in the plan (unless trivially related)
- Flag planned changes that weren't made

## Output Format

```json
{
  "agentName": "spec-compliance-review",
  "status": "pass|warn|fail|skip",
  "issues": [
    {
      "file": "<file path>",
      "line": null,
      "severity": "error|warning|suggestion",
      "message": "<what's wrong>",
      "category": "unmet-criterion|uncovered-scenario|scope-violation|plan-deviation",
      "criterion": "<the acceptance criterion or scenario name>",
      "suggestedFix": "<what to do>",
      "confidence": "high|medium|none"
    }
  ],
  "criteria_coverage": {"met": 0, "unmet": 0, "partial": 0},
  "scenario_coverage": {"covered": 0, "uncovered": 0, "partial": 0},
  "summary": "<one line>"
}
```

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No spec artifacts found"}` when:

- No plan file (with its slice scenarios), spec, design doc, or acceptance criteria can be located for the target — locate with `Glob("docs/specs/**/*.md")` / `Glob("plans/**")`, never a bare `Read` of the directory (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/directory-enumeration.md`, Whole-file load: a short single-rule reference); also check the plan for a recorded `--spec-issue <url>` reference before concluding no spec exists
- Target is a standalone script or utility with no associated specification

## Severity Rules

- Unmet acceptance criterion → `error` (always)
- Uncovered scenario → `error` (always)
- Scope violation → `warning` (may be intentional)
- Plan deviation → `warning` (may be justified)
- Cosmetic divergence from the plan that meets every criterion (naming, file placement, ordering) → `suggestion`

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the shared challenger loop in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md` (Whole-file load: the slim shared methodology — The Loop + Output format — read in full), then work these spec-compliance-review-specific challenges:

- Did you load EVERY spec artifact (spec, plan, design doc, all `.feature` files), or stop at the first one found?
- For each acceptance criterion, did you locate BOTH the implementation and its test — not assume a test exists because the criterion "looks covered"?
- For every scope-violation finding, did you confirm the change maps to no criterion, including criteria in linked or related slices?
- Did you check for planned changes that were NOT made (missing files), not just unplanned files that were added?
- Is every `error` (unmet criterion, uncovered scenario) backed by the specific criterion/scenario text, not a paraphrase?

Append confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.
