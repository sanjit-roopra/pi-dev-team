# Architecture Review

Scope: always
Cites:
- architecture-assessment
- adversarial-review-protocol

Output JSON: per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/review-agent-output-contract.md` (Whole-file load: short, canonical schema).

Status: pass=aligned with architecture, warn=minor drift, fail=boundary or pattern violation
Severity: error=violates documented architectural decision or introduces prohibited dependency; warning=diverges from established pattern without documented rationale; suggestion=opportunity to align more closely with architectural intent
Confidence: high=clear violation of explicit rule (wrong import direction, prohibited dependency); medium=pattern inconsistency identified, correct fix requires architectural context; none=requires human judgment (architectural tradeoff decisions, ADR authoring)

Context needs: project-structure

**No Bash grant — never invoke git yourself (#1734).** This agent's `tools:`
line has no Bash. The orchestrator's dispatch for `Context needs:
project-structure` already includes full files, the directory tree, and (for
a diff-scoped review) a changed-file list with each file's change type
(`A`/`M`/`D`/`R`/`C`). Everything this agent needs to know what changed
arrives in that payload — do not attempt `git diff`, `git status`, or any
other git/Bash call to "see what changed" first; that call is denied and
surfaces as a spurious tool-error finding instead of a real one.

## Knowledge Files

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/architecture-assessment.md` before starting analysis. Whole-file load: the agent uses every section — exploration patterns, ADR compliance checks, layer boundary rules, dependency direction, pattern consistency, and the optional MCP guidance.

## MCP Tools (Optional)

Probe for these tools at session start. Use if available, fall back
to Glob/Grep/Read if not.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Code knowledge graph (e.g., GitNexus) | Cross-repo dependency mapping, blast radius, integration context |
| Documentation MCP (Confluence, Notion) | Architecture docs, design decisions, system context |

Note tool availability in output for the orchestrator's report.

## Explore

Follow the discovery sequence in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/architecture-assessment.md#discovery-sequence`
to map the architectural landscape: ADRs, architecture docs, layer
definitions, and import patterns.

If no architecture documentation and no discernible layered structure exists, return skip.

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No architectural structure to analyze"}` when:

- No architecture documentation (ADRs, arch docs, README with architecture section) exists
- Project is a single-file script or utility with no module boundaries
- Target is infrastructure-only (CI/CD, build configs) with no application code

## Detect

### ADR compliance

- Code introduces a library or framework that a recorded ADR explicitly prohibited or deferred
- An ADR mandates a pattern (e.g., event sourcing for order state, hexagonal ports for external services) and the change bypasses it without a superseding ADR
- An ADR decision is reversed in code without a corresponding ADR update (status should be `Superseded`)

### Layer boundary violations

Identify the layer structure from architecture docs or directory conventions, then detect imports that cross in the wrong direction:

- Infrastructure layer imported directly by domain layer (e.g., ORM entity in domain service)
- Presentation/UI layer importing application or domain internals directly (bypassing use case layer)
- Domain layer importing from application or infrastructure layer
- Cross-bounded-context direct imports (one context importing domain types from another instead of using published events or shared kernel)

Flag: the specific import statement, source file, target file, and which boundary is crossed.

### Dependency direction

- New circular dependency introduced between modules that previously had a clear direction
- A module that should be a leaf node (no outbound dependencies to core business logic) now depends on core
- Third-party library coupled directly into domain or application layer instead of wrapped behind an interface

### Pattern consistency

- New code uses a different pattern for the same concern when an established pattern exists:
  - Repository pattern used in some places, direct DB access in new code
  - Event-based communication used for cross-context calls in some modules, direct calls in new code
  - Error handling strategy (result types vs exceptions) inconsistent with established codebase pattern
- A new abstraction is introduced that duplicates an existing one (two repository base classes, two HTTP client wrappers)

### Prohibited practices

Grep for patterns that architecture documentation explicitly bans:

- `new` keyword constructing infrastructure objects inside domain (if docs prohibit this)
- Direct `fetch`/`axios`/`HttpClient` calls outside designated HTTP adapter layer
- Direct DB client calls outside designated repository layer

### Database change safety

When the changeset includes schema migrations or DDL, apply the signals in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/architecture-assessment.md#database-change-safety`:

- A migration drops or renames a column/table that the same release's application code still reads or writes — breaks running instances mid-rollout and blocks rollback
- A roll-forward migration ships with no paired roll-back script
- A new `NOT NULL` column or constraint added with no backfill step
- App code and schema assumed to deploy atomically (reads a structure added in the same deploy)

Flag the migration file and the coupled application code; fix direction is to split into expand/contract across releases.

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the shared challenger loop in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md` (Whole-file load: the slim shared methodology — The Loop + Output format — read in full), then work these arch-review-specific challenges:

- Did you read the ADRs before reviewing? Every finding should reference whether it contradicts an ADR.
- Did you check cross-boundary imports in BOTH directions (not just infrastructure → domain)?
- For each "inconsistent pattern" finding, did you verify the established pattern exists in at least 2 other locations?
- Did you check for circular dependencies introduced by the changeset?
- Are there new abstractions that duplicate existing ones?
- For any schema migration in the changeset, did you confirm it is reversible (paired roll-back) and backward-compatible with the currently-deployed app version?

Append confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.
