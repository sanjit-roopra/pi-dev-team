# Component Architecture Review

Scope: added-only
- **/*.jsx
- **/*.tsx
- **/*.vue
- **/*.svelte
- **/*.component.ts
- **/*.component.html
Cites:
- frontend-component-architecture
- adversarial-review-protocol

Scope: newly-added frontend component files matching the globs above
(`.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, Angular `*.component.ts` + their
templates) in `/code-review`'s per-diff panel — merely *modifying* an
existing component file does not trigger this agent there (#1733):
whole-inventory duplication assessment is best judged against the entire
component set, which is exactly what `/repo-review` (#1735) runs this agent
against, unconditionally, every pass. Skip this agent entirely if the target
has no frontend component files.

Output JSON: per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/review-agent-output-contract.md` (Whole-file load: short, canonical schema).

Status: pass=components are well factored, warn=extraction or composition opportunities, fail=duplicated render/behavior forcing multi-site edits
Severity: error=semantic UI duplication (a behavioral rule copied across components), warning=high-value extraction or prop-drilling fix, suggestion=composition/API-consistency cleanup
Confidence: high=mechanical (extract the repeated subtree, call the existing primitive); medium=judgment call (is this duplication semantic or incidental? right granularity?); none=requires product knowledge (will these diverge?)

Context needs: full-file

## Knowledge Files

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/frontend-component-architecture.md` before analysis.
Whole-file load: it is a short reference catalog the agent scans end-to-end —
the detection categories, the rule-of-three / semantic-vs-incidental tests, and
the framework mapping are independent indexes used together on every review.

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No frontend component files in target"}` when:

- No `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, or component-rendering `.js`/`.ts`/Angular files exist in the target
- All target files are backend, config, test, or documentation files

## Detect

Duplicate render logic:

- The same JSX/template subtree repeated across 3+ components with only data substituted (card, list row, modal, empty-state, table)
- Severity `error` when a behavioral rule (validation, formatting, a11y wiring) is duplicated and would force multi-site edits

Reusable-primitive extraction candidates:

- Repeated form-field/button/input-group/skeleton/pagination/toast patterns re-implemented inline instead of a shared component
- Inline reimplementation of a primitive that already exists in the project — name the existing component to call instead

Component granularity:

- God component mixing data fetching + business logic + several unrelated UI regions — split along the seams
- Over-fragmentation: one trivial wrapper component per field where a single parameterized component would do

Prop drilling:

- State/callbacks threaded through 3+ intermediate components that do not use them — lift to context/store or compose via `children`/slots
- Two-level pass-through is `suggestion`; three+ is `warning`

Inconsistent component APIs:

- Sibling components exposing drifting contracts: event-handler naming (`onClick`/`onPress`/`handleClick`), boolean vs enum for one concept, mismatched prop shapes
- Recommend one convention and align the outliers

Composition over configuration:

- Components accumulating mode/variant flags that switch large render branches — recompose via slots/`children`/compound components
- `renderX`/`content` props that re-implement composition the framework offers via `children`/slots

Cross-feature reuse:

- The same visual primitive reimplemented independently in two feature folders (two hand-rolled modals, two date pickers) — promote one to the shared layer and delete the duplicate

Library barrel / public exports:

- A shared component directory (`components/`, `ui/`, design-system) with no `index` barrel re-exporting its components, or a barrel that omits newly added reusable components — `warning`; add/update the `index` so the library has one public entry point
- Consumers deep-importing internals when a barrel entry exists — `suggestion`; import through the barrel

## Semantic vs Incidental Duplication Test

Before flagging duplication, ask: "If the visual or behavioral rule changes, must
every copy change together?" If yes → semantic duplication (flag it). If the copies
serve different product concepts expected to diverge → incidental similarity (leave
it). Apply the rule of three — flag the third occurrence, not the second.

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the shared challenger loop in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md` (Whole-file load: the slim shared methodology — The Loop + Output format — read in full), then work these component-architecture-review-specific challenges:

- For every duplication finding, did you apply the semantic-vs-incidental test and the rule of three before flagging?
- Did you check whether an extraction candidate already exists as a shared component you should point the caller at?
- For each prop-drilling finding, did you confirm the intermediate components truly don't use the prop and the chain is 3+ levels deep?
- Did you verify an API-consistency finding against the actual sibling components, not an assumed convention?
- Did you avoid recommending a flag-laden mega-component where composition is the better fix?
- For a shared component layer, did you check it has an `index` barrel that re-exports its components, and that newly added components are exported — without demanding a barrel for one-off or feature-local components?
- Did you defer non-UI logic duplication, accessibility, naming, and styling to their owning agents instead of double-reporting?

Append confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.

## Ignore

Accessibility (a11y-review), framework reactivity correctness (react-reactivity-review, vue-reactivity-review, angular-reactivity-review), functional-purity/mutation style (js-fp-review), non-UI business-logic duplication and SRP/coupling (structure-review, refactor-opportunity-review), naming conventions (naming-review), pure styling/CSS concerns
