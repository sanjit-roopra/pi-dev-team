# Browser Testing Skill

## Overview

This skill provides reusable patterns for browser-based testing and visual verification using Playwright. Agents load this skill when they need to interact with a running application through a real browser.

## Prerequisites

Playwright must be installed with at least the Chromium browser — `/project-init` installs it for frontend projects, or install manually:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Playwright Patterns

| Category | Description |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Navigation | `goto`, `waitForSelector`, `waitForNavigation` with network-idle |
| Form Interaction | `fill`, `selectOption`, `check`, `setInputFiles`, submit |
| Click Actions | Click by selector/text, double-click, right-click, hover |
| Screenshots | Full page, viewport, element, and clipped region captures |
| Waiting Strategies | Selector appear/disappear, text match, network response |
| Data Extraction | `textContent`, `getAttribute`, `inputValue`, `count`, `isVisible` |
| Script Template | Full `/browse` boilerplate with error capture and console logging |
| Error Handling | Common timeout, connection, and protocol errors with resolutions |
| CAPTCHA/Auth Handoff | Detect walls, report to user, resume from `storageState` |

See `references/playwright-patterns.md` for full code examples, the script template, and the error handling table.

## Fast Feedback Loop

A verification pass is usually a *sequence* of related checks, not one isolated check — keep the loop cheap:

- **Batch checks into one session.** Launch the browser once, run the full sequence of actions/waits/screenshots needed for the verification pass, then close — don't relaunch a fresh browser per individual check.
- **Reserve `networkidle` for the first navigation.** After the initial `goto`, a re-check following a known, small change should wait on the specific signal that changed (`waitForSelector`, `waitForResponse`) rather than re-waiting on full network idle.
- **Skip the reload when nothing routed.** If the change under verification didn't require a new route or a fresh document, act on the already-loaded page instead of calling `page.goto()` again or relaunching; use `page.reload()` only when a fresh document is genuinely required.
- **Scope intermediate screenshots.** Prefer element/clip screenshots for the in-between checks in a sequence; reserve full-page screenshots for the final verification.

The underlying principle — prefer the cheapest deterministic signal over a broad, expensive wait — is the same one that governs CI-gate test-suite design, but this section applies it to a single interactive verification session, not a project's test architecture.

## Visual Verification Guidelines

When interpreting screenshots, describe:

1. **Layout**: Is the page structure correct? Any overlapping elements, broken grids, or overflow?
2. **Content**: Is the expected text/data visible? Any placeholder text or missing images?
3. **State**: Are interactive elements in the right state? (buttons enabled/disabled, forms populated, etc.)
4. **Responsiveness**: At the given viewport, does the layout adapt correctly?
5. **Errors**: Any visible error messages, 404 pages, or console errors captured?

Compare observations against acceptance criteria when available. Flag discrepancies as findings.
