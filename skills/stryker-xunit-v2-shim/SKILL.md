description: Build a xunit.v2 Stryker shim so Stryker.NET produces a valid mutation score for a xunit.v3 test project. Stryker.NET cannot observe mutant kills through xunit.v3 (it runs on the Microsoft Testing Platform), so a normal run reports a false near-zero score with almost every mutant reported Survived. Use this BEFORE running Stryker whenever the target .NET test project references xunit.v3 — including when mutation is enabled via /test-improve or /mutation-testing, or you are about to run dotnet-stryker — and as a rescue when a run already reported ~0% or everything Survived or the user says the score looks suspiciously low. When Stryker and xunit.v3 both appear, build the shim first.

# Stryker xunit.v2 Shim

Role: worker. Builds measurement scaffolding and does not modify the tests it
measures.

## Why this exists

Stryker.NET (through at least 4.15/4.16) **cannot observe mutant kills through
xunit.v3**. xunit.v3 runs on the Microsoft Testing Platform (MTP), and Stryker's
per-test coverage/kill mapping doesn't work across it (stryker-net issues 3237,
3629, 3094). The run completes and the initial test pass even succeeds, so the
failure is **silent** — the only symptom is the score: near-zero, with almost
every mutant reported *Survived* (e.g. `0.13% — 3 killed / 7,685 survived`). That
is the **observation-failure signature**, not a real result.

The fix is a **shim**: a second test project that recompiles the *same test source
files* under xunit.v2 (classic VSTest), which Stryker observes correctly. No test
is rewritten — the shim **links** the existing `.cs` files, so there is one source
of truth. Stryker is then run **from the shim directory** in project mode.

[`references/shim-howto.md`](references/shim-howto.md) has the full reference build
and any edge case not covered here.

## Version scope — this whole skill is a < 5.0.0 workaround

Everything below applies to **Stryker.NET < 5.0.0**. Starting at **5.0.0**
([stryker-net#3752](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-net/issues/3752)),
`-t mtp` + `coverage-analysis: perTest` observes mutant kills through xunit.v3
directly — no shim, no v3-only-construct porting, no operator gate. See
[`csharp-stryker-net.md`](../mutation-testing/references/languages/csharp-stryker-net.md)
for the >= 5.0.0 command and its `concurrency: 1` caveat
([stryker-net#3832](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-net/issues/3832),
tracked for removal in [#2192](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/issues/2192)).
`stryker_xunit_shim_guard.py` detects the installed version
(`hooks/mutation_adapters/stryker_net.py::stryker_net_version()`) and
silent-passes on >= 5.0.0 — this skill's Step 1a operator gate is never
reached on a known >= 5.0.0 install. An undetermined version fails closed to
the < 5.0.0 behavior this skill documents.

## Scope — one path, not the only one

The shim is the path that keeps the **mutant-kill loop** viable on xunit.v3 **below 5.0.0**, because it restores per-test coverage (fast covering-subset per mutant). It is not mandatory for every xunit.v3 run. Within `mutation-kill` the shim-first feasibility gate ([#1158](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/issues/1158)) decides per run: build the shim and probe under `perTest`; if per-test capture works and a round fits the budget, enter the loop; otherwise **degrade** to the no-shim floor — the real v3 suite via `-t mtp` + `coverage-analysis: off` (a real but slow, whole-suite-per-mutant single advisory pass; see [`csharp-stryker-net.md`](../mutation-testing/references/languages/csharp-stryker-net.md)). Before building, [`xunit_v3_feature_detector.py`](../mutation-testing/scripts/xunit_v3_feature_detector.py) classifies the shim-breaking v3-only constructs for the always-ask operator gate in Step 1a — enforced by the guard hook, which stays blocked until the operator's choice is recorded ([#1791](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/issues/1791)). On `exclude`, the guard passes their selections to `generate_shim.py --compile-exclude` itself.

## When to build it

Detection is one check: a test `.csproj` contains `Include="xunit.v3"`. Build the
shim **proactively, before the first Stryker run** — because the failure is silent
(the run succeeds and the score is bogus), waiting for the symptom wastes a full,
possibly hours-long run. As a backstop the `stryker_xunit_shim_guard.py` PreToolUse
hook auto-scaffolds the shim (and reports what it wrote) when you run
`dotnet-stryker` against a xunit.v3 project whose sources are clean, then blocks so
you re-run from the shim dir; when the sources are **not** clean it presents the
Step 1a operator gate instead of scaffolding. Build proactively rather than relying
on the interception. (The guard **exempts** an explicit `-t mtp` run — the no-shim floor — so it is not forced into a shim; see the Scope section.) Within `mutation-kill` the feasibility gate may still degrade to that floor after the shim is built and probed.

One precondition decides whether the shim is cheap: source compatibility with
xunit.v2. `[Fact]`, `[Theory]`, `[InlineData]`, `TheoryData<>`, `MemberData`,
`ClassData`, and `Assert.*` are source-identical between v2 and v3, so a plain
suite ports in minutes. `AutoFixture.Xunit3` `[AutoData]`/`[InlineAutoData]` are
**not** v2-compatible. The Step 1 scope probe quantifies how much of that a suite
has; when there is any, Step 1a's operator gate decides what to do about it —
"say so and stop" is not yours to choose, it is one of four options the operator
picks between.

## Canonical invocations — copy these, don't improvise

Every command below is written to run **from the repository root** unless it says
otherwise. Guessing at the working directory or at a flag that doesn't exist is
the single biggest source of retried commands here ([#1777](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/issues/1777)), so paste these and
substitute only `<TestProject>`.

```bash
# Detect (repo root) — a test .csproj referencing xunit.v3 is the whole check
git grep -l 'Include="xunit.v3"' -- '*.csproj'

# Scope probe (repo root) — every hit is a file the operator gate will ask about
git grep -n 'AutoFixture.Xunit3\|\[AutoData\|InlineAutoData\|AutoMoqData\|MemberAutoData' -- '*.cs'
git grep -n 'TestContext\|Assert.Skip\|Assert.Multiple\|Assert.Equivalent\|ValueTask InitializeAsync' -- '*.cs'

# Green baseline (repo root) — expect the SAME test count as the real project, 0 failed
dotnet build tests/<TestProject>.Mutation -c Release
dotnet test  tests/<TestProject>.Mutation -c Release --no-build

# Mutation run — the ONLY correct form: from the shim dir, no arguments
cd tests/<TestProject>.Mutation
dotnet-stryker

# No-shim floor (from the REAL test project dir) — set "coverage-analysis": "off"
# in stryker-config.json first; it is config-file-only, there is no CLI flag
cd tests/<TestProject>
dotnet-stryker -t mtp
```

Three invocations that look right, fail, and get retried:

| Don't | Do instead | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `dotnet-stryker` at the repo root | `cd tests/<TestProject>.Mutation && dotnet-stryker` | A root run auto-detects the `.sln`, enters solution mode, and binds to the real xunit.v3 project → false ~0% |
| `dotnet-stryker --solution ../../App.sln` (or a `SolutionPath` in the shim's config) | omit it entirely — `test-projects` in the shim's `stryker-config.json` is the selection | With both set Stryker enumerates the solution and prefers the v3 project over the shim (the SolutionPath trap, [#557](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/issues/557)) |
| `dotnet-stryker --coverage-analysis off` | set `"coverage-analysis"` in `stryker-config.json` | `coverage-analysis` is **config-file-only** in Stryker.NET 4.15 — there is no CLI flag, so the run dies on an unknown option |

Shim *selection* is not a command-line argument at all: it is the cwd having no
`.sln` (project mode) plus the `test-projects` entry the generator wrote. If a
run reports the observation-failure signature from a shim directory, check those
two before reaching for a flag.

## Workflow

### Read before editing

Before editing an artifact this workflow has already produced, read it first — each of these only exists once the workflow has reached the step that creates it, so don't expect all three on the proactive, before-the-first-run path:

- the mutant-survivors report (`StrykerOutput/<timestamp>/reports/mutation-report.json`) — once a Stryker run has completed
- the shim config (`stryker-config.json`) — once Step 2 has created it
- the step files (the shim's linked test source files) — once they exist on disk

**Converged-state check.** Compare each file's current content against the
target state described in the step you're about to run before editing it.
If a file already matches its target state, skip re-editing it — do not
overwrite a file that has already converged.

### Step 1 — Scope probe (decide whether the shim is cheap)

Run against the branch under test to find v3-only usage that would need porting:

```bash
# v3-incompatible attribute usage in test sources
git grep -l "AutoFixture.Xunit3\|\[AutoData\|InlineAutoData\|AutoMoqData\|MemberAutoData" -- 'tests/**/*.cs'
# other v3-only APIs
git grep -l "TestContext\|Assert.Skip\|Assert.Multiple\|IAsyncLifetime\|Assert.Equivalent" -- 'tests/**/*.cs'
```

Each hit is a file the operator gate below will ask about. **Zero hits → the shim
builds unattended, proceed to Step 2.** Any hits → Step 1a; do not decide for the
operator, and in particular do not quietly conclude the approach "isn't a good
fit" — that is one of four options, and it is theirs to pick.

### Step 1a — Operator gate (always-ask; you cannot skip it)

When the probe finds shim-breaking constructs, the operator chooses how to
proceed. This is enforced, not advisory: `stryker_xunit_shim_guard.py` blocks
every `dotnet-stryker` invocation against that project until a choice is
**recorded**, so paraphrasing the gate or picking on the operator's behalf does
not get the run through ([#1791](https://github.com/bdfinst/agentic-dev-team/issues/1791)).

The block body is the question, already assembled: the per-construct breakdown
from [`xunit_v3_feature_detector.py`](../mutation-testing/scripts/xunit_v3_feature_detector.py) (which construct, translatable or
not, coverage-bearing or neutral, with file and line), the four options with
their tradeoffs, and the exact `record` command carrying this blocker set's
fingerprint. Present the four options to the operator with `AskUserQuestion`,
then run the printed command verbatim — the fingerprint is per-blocker-set, so
don't reuse one from an earlier run.

| Choice | What happens next |
|---|---|
| `port` | Rewrite the flagged constructs to v2-compatible forms (Step 3). The guard auto-scaffolds once the sources are clean. |
| `exclude` | The guard scaffolds with `--compile-exclude` on the flagged files. They stay **unmeasured** — their mutants report as survivors. |
| `skip` | Deactivate just the offending tests, then re-run. Clears the gate **only** where the deactivation removes the construct itself (`[Fact(Explicit = true)]` → `[Fact(Skip = "…")]`); a construct in a test body or on a data attribute stays in the source the shim compiles, so those need `port` or `exclude`. Undo at teardown. |
| `degrade` | Skip the shim; run the no-shim floor (`-t mtp`, `coverage-analysis: off`) for one slow advisory pass. Only relevant below 5.0.0 — this whole gate is bypassed on a known >= 5.0.0 install (see Version scope above). |

The fingerprint is **mandatory** — it is what scopes a decision to the blockers
the operator actually saw. Add a new blocking file after they answered and the
gate **re-asks**. A reply matching none of the four is re-asked with the same
four; never default or guess.

### Step 2 — Scaffold the shim project

Use the bundled script — it reads the real test `.csproj` and writes the shim
`.csproj` (mirroring every non-xunit `PackageReference` verbatim, swapping in the
xunit.v2 stack, setting `RootNamespace`/`AssemblyName`, adding the linked-`Compile`
glob and the product `ProjectReference`) plus a `stryker-config.json`:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/stryker-xunit-v2-shim/scripts/generate_shim.py" tests/<TestProject>/<TestProject>.csproj \
  --mutate-exclude '**/gRPC/**/*.cs' --mutate-exclude '**/Caching/**/*.cs'
```

It creates `tests/<TestProject>.Mutation/` beside the real project. Pass
`--mutate-exclude` for each product folder that's genuinely out of mutation scope
(generated code, gRPC stubs, etc.); omit if none.

Why these choices matter, so you can fix the file by hand if the script's
heuristics miss something in an unusual `.csproj`:

- **`RootNamespace` must equal the real project's root namespace** — the linked
  sources resolve the same types, so a mismatch breaks compilation.
- **`AssemblyName` must differ** (`.Mutation`) so both projects coexist.
- **Non-xunit package versions must match exactly** — a version drift causes
  compile errors in the linked sources.
- **Keep the shim out of the `.sln`** (see Step 4 — this is what forces project
  mode). Do not `dotnet sln add` it.

### Step 3 — Port v3-only constructs (only files Step 1 flagged)

Rewrite v3-only APIs to behavior-equivalent v2-compatible forms, **in the real
test project's sources** (the shim links those same files, so one edit satisfies
both). Verify each replacement still compiles under v3 too.

| v3-only | v2-compatible replacement |
|---|---|
| `TestContext.Current.CancellationToken` | `CancellationToken.None` (token was never cancelled for a passing test) |
| `[AutoData]` / `[InlineAutoData]` | manual `new Fixture()` in the body, or `[Theory]` + `[InlineData]` — heavier; avoid the shim if pervasive |
| `Assert.Skip(...)` | `[Fact(Skip="…")]` or a guard-and-return |

### Step 3a — Grant internals access

If the product exposes internals to the real test assembly via
`InternalsVisibleTo`, add the shim assembly too (its tests exercise `internal`
types):

```csharp
[assembly: System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleTo("<TestProject>.Mutation")]
```

### Step 4 — Run Stryker FROM the shim directory (the critical part)

```bash
cd tests/<TestProject>.Mutation
dotnet-stryker
```

**This directory choice is the whole game.** A bare `dotnet-stryker` at repo root
auto-detects the single `.sln`, enters **solution mode**, ignores test-project
selection, and binds to the real xunit.v3 project → false ~0%. Running from a
directory with **no `.sln`** forces **project mode**: Stryker uses the shim in the
cwd and finds the product through its `ProjectReference`. The `stryker-config.json`
the script wrote (with `coverage-analysis: perTest` and `additional-timeout:
30000`) lives beside the shim; perTest mode is required for kill observation and
the raised timeout keeps slow mutants from being scored as timeouts.

### Step 5 — Validate BEFORE the full run

A full run can take hours; a wrong harness wastes all of it. Two gates:

1. **Green baseline** — the shim builds and every test passes:
   ```bash
   dotnet build tests/<TestProject>.Mutation -c Release
   dotnet test  tests/<TestProject>.Mutation -c Release --no-build
   # expect the SAME test count as the real project, 0 failed
   ```
2. **Kills register** — temporarily scope `mutate` to one small, well-covered file
   and run Stryker from the shim dir. Expect a **non-zero** score with real kills.
   If this scoped run is still ~0%, the harness is wrong — **do not launch the full
   run**; recheck the directory (Step 4) and the shim references.

### Step 6 — Launch the full run, then sanity-check

Widen `mutate` back to the full scope and launch. A full Stryker run is
long-running — start it in the background and watch it (a Monitor plus a periodic
status check), rather than blocking on it. If the periodic check is a scheduled
wake-up, follow the calling contract in
[`knowledge/long-run-waiting.md`](../../knowledge/long-run-waiting.md) — a
wake-up armed without its replay instruction schedules nothing.

Before recording any score, **reject the observation-failure signature**: a
near-zero score with almost everything *Survived* means it bound to the v3 project
again — rerun from the shim dir. A healthy run kills the majority of covered
mutants. Output lands at
`StrykerOutput/<timestamp>/reports/mutation-report.{html,json}`.

## Teardown

The shim, its `stryker-config.json`, the `InternalsVisibleTo` line, and any v3→v2
source ports are **measurement scaffolding**. If you were measuring a throwaway
branch/worktree, discard it. If the shim lives in the repo, keep it **out of the
`.sln` and out of CI test discovery** so it never runs as a normal suite and never
double-counts.
