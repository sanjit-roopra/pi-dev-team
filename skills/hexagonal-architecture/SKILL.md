# Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

## Overview
Design systems with clear separation between business logic and infrastructure. The domain core has zero dependencies on outer layers; all external interactions flow through explicitly defined ports and adapters.

## Core Concepts

### Ports
- Interfaces that express application intent independent of technology
- **Inbound ports** (driving): define use cases the application exposes (e.g., `CreateOrderUseCase`)
- **Outbound ports** (driven): define what the application needs from the outside world (e.g., `OrderRepository`, `PaymentGateway`)

### Adapters
- Concrete implementations that connect ports to external systems
- **Inbound adapters**: REST controllers, CLI handlers, message consumers, GraphQL resolvers
- **Outbound adapters**: database repositories, HTTP clients, message publishers, file storage

### Dependency Rule
- All dependencies point inward toward the domain core
- Domain knows nothing about adapters, frameworks, or infrastructure
- Adapters depend on ports, never the reverse

## Project Structure

```

│   ├── model/           # Entities, value objects, aggregates
│   ├── service/         # Domain services
│   └── event/           # Domain events
├── application/         # Use cases / application services
│   ├── port/
│   │   ├── inbound/     # Use case interfaces (driving ports)
│   │   └── outbound/    # Repository/gateway interfaces (driven ports)
│   └── service/         # Use case implementations
├── infrastructure/      # Framework and technology concerns
│   ├── config/          # Dependency injection, app configuration
│   └── persistence/     # Database migrations, ORM config
└── adapter/
    ├── inbound/         # Controllers, CLI, event consumers
    └── outbound/        # Repository impls, API clients, message publishers
```

## Steps

### 1. Identify Boundaries
- Enumerate all external dependencies (databases, APIs, message brokers, file systems)
- Identify each as an inbound or outbound interaction
- **Graph-assisted discovery.** Prefer CodeGraph/Repowise over raw `Grep` for
  locating adapters, port implementations, and cross-layer imports — see
  [`knowledge/codegraph-vs-graphify.md`](../../knowledge/codegraph-vs-graphify.md)
  for tool selection and the fallback contract.

### 2. Define Ports
- Create an inbound port interface for each use case the application exposes
- Create an outbound port interface for each external dependency the application needs

### 3. Implement Adapters
- Build an adapter for each port connecting to the concrete technology
- Verify all dependencies point inward (adapters depend on ports, never the reverse)

### 4. Validate Structure
- Confirm domain layer has zero imports from infrastructure or adapter layers
- Confirm tests can substitute adapters without touching domain logic

## Output
Report structural compliance as a list of violations (port without adapter, domain importing infrastructure, etc.) or confirm the structure passes all checks. Be concise — violations only; no narration for passing checks.

## Constraints
- Do not embed framework dependencies in the domain layer
- Do not bypass ports with direct infrastructure access from application services

## Guidelines
- Every external dependency gets its own adapter behind a port
- Test domain logic by substituting adapters (e.g., in-memory repository for unit tests)
- Introduce a new port when a new category of external interaction appears
- Reuse existing ports when the interaction pattern is the same
- Keep the application layer thin: orchestrate domain objects, don't duplicate domain logic
