  Author Gherkin scenarios for the entire public interface of a repository
  — every API endpoint, UI screen, batch-job entry point, library export,
  and event type — at the observable boundary, not internal steps. The
  scenarios become the executable specification of intended behavior before
  any test or production-code change lands. After the operator approves the
  scenarios at the Phase-2 gate, this skill also creates the Phase-4 and
  Phase-5 `[Component tests]` Stories that will bind their test code to
  specific scenario names — so the component tests are written from the
  approved Gherkin, not from the assessment.

# Gherkin Public

Role: worker. Standalone Gherkin authoring skill. Reads the component map produced by `/cd-test-architecture` and writes `.feature` files at the **public boundary** of each component — the surface an external caller actually depends on. Internal steps are out of scope here; scenarios describe observable outputs.

You have been invoked with the `/gherkin-public` command.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

- Positional: `<repo-path>` — the repo under modernization.
- `--repo-slug <slug>` — namespace under `.claude/memory/<workflow>/`. Defaults to the last path segment of `<repo-path>`.

If `<repo-path>` is absent, ask the operator.

## Steps

### 1. Load the component map

Read `.claude/memory/<workflow>/<slug>/phase-1.md` for the components & patterns table. If it's missing, tell the operator Phase 1 has not run and stop.

### 2. Pick the output directory

- Prefer `features/<workflow>/` if `<repo>/features/` already exists (matches the repo's existing Gherkin layout).
- Otherwise write to `<repo>/specs/<workflow>/`.
- Create the directory if missing.

### 3. Author scenarios per public surface

For each component in the map, generate one `.feature` file per public surface using the pattern's template. Every scenario MUST cover at least one success and one failure path. Every scenario MUST be observable at the boundary — no scenario describes an internal call.

**Grounding scenarios in real behavior.** The component map names each surface but not its actual branches or error-handling depth. Prefer CodeGraph/Repowise over raw `Grep` to inspect a surface's real failure conditions before writing its failure scenario, rather than inferring one from the surface name alone — see [`knowledge/codegraph-vs-graphify.md`](../../knowledge/codegraph-vs-graphify.md) for tool selection and the fallback contract.

**Titles must be specific enough to identify the surface without relying on the `Feature:` header for context (issue #1526).** A `Scenario:` title read in isolation — in a CI report, a BDD runner's scenario list, or a coverage dashboard — must be recognizable as belonging to its specific surface, not a generic category label that could describe any endpoint (e.g. `returns error for invalid input`, `handles success case`). Prefer wording that names the concrete condition or resource involved (e.g. `rejects the request when the id path parameter is non-numeric`, `returns the created order with a 201 and Location header`) over a bare category name. A title that is merely a paraphrase of the surface name (the same words as the `Feature:` line, reworded) fails this rule.

**API Provider** (one `.feature` per endpoint):

```gherkin
Feature: <method> <path>
  As an external API consumer
  I want <documented behavior>
  So that <user value>

  Scenario: <success-path-summary>
    Given <request shape + auth context>
    When the client calls <method> <path>
    Then the response status is <code>
    And the body conforms to <schema reference>

  Scenario: <failure-mode-summary, per the assessment's failure-modes list>
    Given <invalid request>
    When the client calls <method> <path>
    Then the response status is <code>
    And the error body includes <field>
```

**User Interface** (one `.feature` per user-facing flow):

```gherkin
Feature: <flow name>
  As a <user role>
  I want <task>
  So that <outcome>

  Scenario: <happy path>
    Given <starting screen + preconditions>
    When the user <observable action sequence>
    Then the user sees <observable outcome>
    And the URL is <route> (or app state is <state>)

  Scenario: <validation / error path>
    Given <invalid input>
    When the user submits
    Then the user sees <error message>
    And no destructive change has occurred
```

**Batch / Scheduled Job** (one `.feature` per job; the entry point is the surface):

```gherkin
Feature: <job name> — scheduled entry point

  Scenario: <success path — full input → expected outputs>
    Given the input source contains <fixture rows / messages>
    When the job is triggered at its scheduled entry point
    Then the job exits with code 0
    And the output sink contains <expected rows / files / events>
    And the run-metrics show <count> processed

  Scenario: <partial-failure path>
    Given the input source contains <N valid + M invalid rows>
    When the job is triggered
    Then the job exits with code <non-zero per the contract, or 0 with reported errors>
    And the dead-letter sink contains the M invalid rows
    And no valid row was dropped
```

**CLI / Library** (one `.feature` per command or exported function):

```gherkin
Feature: <command-or-function>

  Scenario: <documented success>
    Given <preconditions / stdin / args>
    When the caller invokes <cmd-or-fn> with <args>
    Then the exit code is <n> (or the return value is <shape>)
    And stdout contains <pattern>

  Scenario: <documented error>
    Given <invalid input>
    When the caller invokes <cmd-or-fn>
    Then the exit code is <non-zero>
    And stderr contains <message>
```

**API / Event Consumer** (one `.feature` per outbound call or emitted event):

```gherkin
Feature: <component> emits <event-type>

  Scenario: <triggering input → expected emission>
    Given <inbound trigger>
    When the component processes it
    Then an event of type <type> is emitted to <sink>
    And the event body matches <schema>
```

**Event Producer / Stateful Service** — combine the API Provider and Event Consumer templates as appropriate.

### 4. Cite the assessment

In every `.feature` file's header, include:

```
# Source: .claude/memory/<workflow>/<slug>/phase-1.md
# Component: <name>
# Pattern: <pattern>
# Public surface: <surface-id>
```

This lets the operator trace each scenario back to a component row at the Phase-2 human sign-off (Step 6), and lets `/feature-file-validation` — which `/code-review` invokes automatically whenever `.feature` or step-definition files are in the changeset — verify each scenario has matching test automation once the bound Stories are built.

### 4b. Adversarial Gherkin Quality Review

Dispatch the adversarial review against Step 3's authored `.feature` files
unconditionally — this skill has no `none` mode, so every completed Step 3
authors at least one `.feature` file, and no operator opt-in is required.
This runs **before** Step 5 (Persist phase-2 progress) and before the Step 6
human sign-off, so the operator sees the dual-agent findings alongside the
scenario inventory at the sign-off decision point.

Follow `knowledge/gherkin-quality-review-dispatch.md` for the shared dispatch,
aggregation, failure-handling, and zero-findings mechanics — this step states
only what's specific to `/gherkin-public`: each of the two
`gherkin-quality-critic` instances receives, for every surface reviewed, that
surface's `.feature` file content plus its Step 4 header (`# Source:`,
`# Component:`, `# Pattern:`, `# Public surface:`). The resulting
`agreed`/`single-source` buckets feed Step 8's two new report sections.

### 5. Persist phase-2 progress

Write `.claude/memory/<workflow>/<slug>/phase-2.md` with:

- Number of `.feature` files written + their paths.
- Surface coverage per component (one row per component: surfaces touched / surfaces total).
- Any components for which the operator must hand-author scenarios (e.g. heavy UI flows the worker could not derive from the map alone) — call these out explicitly.
- The scenario inventory: per component, the full list of `<feature-file>::<scenario-name>` pairs.

### 6. STOP for human sign-off

This is the Gherkin-review human gate the calling orchestrator (when one is used) enforces. Print the scenario inventory and wait. Do NOT proceed to Step 7 (Story creation) until the operator signs off on the scenarios. The Gherkin is the executable spec — Stories that bind to it must not be created from un-reviewed scenarios.

### 7. Create `[Component tests]` Stories bound to the approved scenarios

Once the operator has approved the scenarios (orchestrator passes `--create-stories` or `/gherkin-public` is re-invoked after approval), create one `[Component tests]` Story per (component, surface) pair via the resolved tracker CLI from Phase 0:

- **Title:** `[Component tests] <component> · <surface-id>` (e.g. `[Component tests] orders-api · POST /orders`).
- **Phase tag:** `Phase-4` when the surface is fully reachable at existing seams (per the seam-reachability table in `phase-1.md`); `Phase-5` when one or more scenarios require a `[Refactor-for-testability]` Story.
- **Predecessor links:**
  - `[Baseline]` for the same component (from Phase 1) — baseline before tests.
  - For Phase-5 Stories, also the matching `[Refactor-for-testability]` Story for any scenario that requires the refactor.
- **Body — Acceptance Criteria (this is the binding):**

  ```markdown
  ## Approved Gherkin scenarios (binding contract)

  All scenarios below MUST have a passing test in this Story. Each test:
  - cites the source `.feature` file + scenario name in its name or a leading comment;
  - exercises the scenario via the public surface (no internal-step assertions);
  - runs deterministically with no off-machine dependencies (airplane test);
  - lands at the **component** layer per the MinimumCD taxonomy.

  Source: `features/<workflow>/<surface>.feature`

  - [ ] `Scenario: <success-path-summary>`
  - [ ] `Scenario: <failure-mode-summary>`
  - [ ] `Scenario: <…>`

  ## Testing approach

  Binding mode: `<bdd-runner | xunit-with-annotations>` (from Phase 0).

  - `bdd-runner` — generate step definitions for the scenarios above using the project's BDD runner (cucumber-js / pytest-bdd / behave / cucumber-jvm / SpecFlow / godog). Step definitions go under the project's existing step-defs directory.
  - `xunit-with-annotations` — write one xUnit-style test method per scenario. The test method name SHALL mirror the scenario name (e.g. `Scenario: rejects invalid total` → `test_rejects_invalid_total()` / `RejectsInvalidTotal()` / etc.). The Given / When / Then become structured comments at the top of each test body, citing the feature file path.

  ## Doubles

  <In-memory doubles for third-party dependencies + local containers / loopback for team-owned infrastructure. No off-machine calls.>
  ```

Record the **scenario → Story-id** map in `.claude/memory/<workflow>/<slug>/gherkin-bindings.json`:

```json
{
  "features/<workflow>/orders-post.feature::accepts valid order": 311,
  "features/<workflow>/orders-post.feature::rejects invalid total": 311,
  "features/<workflow>/orders-get.feature::returns existing order": 312,
  …
}
```

Append the Story creations to `phase-2.md` (one row per Story: title, phase tag, scenario count, tracker-id, predecessors). The map lets the operator confirm at the Phase-2 human sign-off that every Scenario has a Story citing it, and lets `/quality-targets-converge` check for an existing binding before proposing a new component-test Story for a coverage gap it finds later.

### 8. Report

Print:

- Output directory used.
- N `.feature` files written.
- Any components flagged for hand-authoring.
- N `[Component tests]` Stories created with scenario-binding count per Story.
- The phase-2 progress file path and the `gherkin-bindings.json` path.

**Print Step 4b's two Gherkin quality sections — "Agreed Gherkin quality
findings" and "Single-source (unconfirmed) Gherkin quality findings" —
distinct from the hand-authoring-flagged-components callout above:** follow
`knowledge/gherkin-quality-review-dispatch.md`'s Report section format for the
exact per-finding line format, the zero-findings sentence, and the
failure-handling wording.

## Notes

- This skill runs in **two passes**, separated by the Phase-2 human gate:
  1. First pass (Steps 1–6) authors the `.feature` files and stops for sign-off.
  2. Second pass (Step 7), invoked by the orchestrator with `--create-stories` after the operator approves, creates the `[Component tests]` Stories bound to the approved scenarios. Splitting the passes ensures the Stories never reference un-reviewed scenarios.
- The Stories produced here become the binding contract `/build` consumes in Phase 4 and Phase 5. Each Story's body cites the exact scenarios its tests must satisfy — the component tests are written **from the approved Gherkin**, not from the assessment.
- `gherkin-bindings.json` is the inverse map (scenario → Story). The operator uses it at the Phase-2 human sign-off to confirm every Scenario in every `.feature` has a Story citing it; `/quality-targets-converge` consults it before proposing a new component-test Story for a coverage gap (see its "Gherkin binding for proposed component tests" step); and `/feature-file-validation` — run automatically by `/code-review` whenever `.feature` files are in the changeset — verifies each `[Component tests]` Story's submitted test code actually references its bound scenarios.
- For UI patterns where the worker cannot infer the flow from the assessment alone, emit a stub `.feature` with the required header and a `# TODO: hand-author scenarios here` block — better to surface the gap than to invent steps. Stub `.feature` files do NOT generate Stories until the operator fills them in.
- **Depth-audit finding (issue #1450): no behavior change here.** `/gherkin-derive` was made to mandatorily analyze controllers, handlers, services, domain logic, workflows, validation rules, error handling, and business processes in depth, because it derives scenarios directly from code with no prior analysis pass. This skill does not: Step 1 reads a pre-built component map (`/cd-test-architecture` Phase 1) rather than discovering surfaces itself, so the in-depth analysis this skill's scenarios rely on already happened upstream, in Phase 1 — transplanting `/gherkin-derive`'s directive here would either duplicate that upstream work or silently mask a gap that actually belongs to `/cd-test-architecture`'s own analysis depth (out of this issue's scope; flagged as a possible follow-up for a human to open separately).
