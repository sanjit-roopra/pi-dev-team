"""mutation_report.py — parse a native mutation report and compute scores.

Generic, stdlib-only, cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows). Carries no repo-specific literal —
project names, controller names, and test-library names live in the report
being parsed, never in this module.

Two native report shapes are supported, normalized to the same internal
``{"files": {"<path>": {"mutants": [...]}}}`` dict before scoring:

- Stryker / Stryker.NET's own ``mutation-report.json`` — read directly via
  the path-based functions (``score_report``, ``survivors_by_mutator``, …).
- mutmut's ``mutmut junitxml`` output — mutmut has no JSON report of its
  own; ``parse_mutmut_junitxml`` converts it into the same internal shape so
  every downstream function (scoring, survivor extraction, file discovery)
  works identically regardless of which tool produced the data.

Two scores are computed side by side:

- **honest score** = Killed / (Killed + Survived + NoCoverage)
  A Timeout is *not* a demonstrated kill — the test never asserted anything;
  the mutant merely ran too long. Counting Timeouts as kills inflates the
  score, so the honest score excludes them from the numerator entirely.

- **reported score** = (Killed + Timeout) / (Killed + Survived + Timeout + NoCoverage)
  The score Stryker itself reports, kept alongside for parity so the gap
  between "what the tool claims" and "what the tests actually prove" is
  visible rather than hidden.

Both scores are expressed as percentages in [0, 100]. An absent or empty
report yields zeroed scores rather than raising.

Stryker.NET mutant statuses: Killed, Survived, Timeout, NoCoverage, Ignored,
CompileError. Only the first four participate in scoring; Ignored and
CompileError are excluded from both numerator and denominator.
