"""mutation_safety_gate.py — shared deny-list scan and commit audit-trail
helpers for mutation_kill_loop.py and mutation_kill_loop_python.py.

Both loops share the same ``--headless`` unattended-commit architecture and
the same threat: a prompt-injection payload in the mutated source could
produce generated test code with side effects that pass build+test and get
committed with zero human review. Each loop supplies its own
language-specific deny-list of patterns; this module owns the single,
shared control flow around them (scan, refuse-on-match; sanitize, then
append an audit trailer) so a bypass fix or a new unsafe category lands
once for both languages instead of drifting between two hand-maintained
copies — a drift risk that fixing this exact vulnerability once already
demonstrated in practice.

``InsertOutcome``/``InsertionRefused`` used to live here too (#1583), but
neither is actually a safety concept — this module is specifically scoped to
the unattended-commit prompt-injection threat model, while ``InsertOutcome``
is returned on plain structural refusals as well (duplicate method/function
names, no methods/tests generated). They moved to ``mutation_kill_shared.py``
instead (#1602), which already exists to hold cross-language types that
aren't safety-specific — see that module's docstring.

Stdlib-only (``re``). See ADR 0014.
