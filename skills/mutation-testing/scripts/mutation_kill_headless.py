"""mutation_kill_headless.py — unattended generation + CLI entry point.

Split out of ``mutation_kill_loop.py`` (#1562): the ``--headless`` CLI
argument parsing and entry point for the C#/Stryker.NET loop. The
agent-driven (default, interactive) path never touches this module — the
mutation-kill agent calls :func:`mutation_kill_loop.run_for_file` directly
with its own ``generate`` hook.

The ``claude --print`` invocation glue itself (``run_claude_headless``,
``resolve_model``, ``strip_code_fences``, ``claude_cli_available``,
``CLAUDE_CLI``) lives in ``mutation_kill_shared.py``, not here (#1601) — it's
reused verbatim by ``mutation_kill_loop_python.py``, and none of it is
C#-specific. This module only builds the C#-flavored prompt
(``build_generation_prompt``) and imports the handful of shared names it
actually calls (``CLAUDE_CLI``, ``resolve_model``, ``claude_cli_available``,
``run_claude_headless``); ``mutation_kill_loop_python.py`` now imports the
same names directly from ``mutation_kill_shared`` too, rather than through
this module, which previously dragged the whole C#/Stryker.NET stack
(``mutation_kill_loop`` and everything it imports) into the Python loop just
to reuse five language-neutral names.

    per-file-downgrade wrapper around :func:`run_claude_headless`.

    The retry/downgrade state (consecutive-failure counter, model in use,
    whether this file already spent its one downgrade) lives in the
    ``retrying_call`` closure below — constructed once per file, here, never
    at module scope — so a new file's generator always starts fresh at the
    top of the ladder regardless of a prior file's downgrade, and concurrent
    files under ``--all --concurrency`` (each with their own closure) never
    leak state to one another. ``round_num`` is derived from how many times
    THIS closure has been invoked (the loop calls its ``generate`` once per
    round), since the shared :data:`Generator` signature carries no round
    number of its own.

    ``on_downgrade``, when given, is passed straight through to
    :func:`mutation_kill_retry.make_retrying_headless_call`. Building the
    ``on_downgrade``/``get_label_override`` audit-trail pair
    (:func:`mutation_kill_retry.make_downgrade_audit_hook`) is this
    module's own ``main()``'s job now (#1908 review) — this function no
    longer constructs one internally or attaches a
    ``label_override_provider`` attribute to the returned ``generate``;
    ``main()`` has ``get_label_override`` directly in scope and wires it
    into :class:`RunContext` itself, so no attribute-smuggling is needed.
