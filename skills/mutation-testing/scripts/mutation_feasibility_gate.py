"""Pre-loop feasibility gate for the mutant-kill loop (#1158, part of #1156).

The mutant-kill loop re-runs mutation after every generation round, so it is
only viable when a scoped run gets **per-test** coverage (covering-subset per
mutant). On an xunit.v3 suite that requires the v2 shim; if the shim path is
declined, or per-test coverage capture fails (#1157) so Stryker degrades to
whole-suite-per-mutant, or a single round would blow a wall-clock budget, then
looping is infeasible — pay the cost once as a single advisory pass, never loop.

This module is the pure, testable **arbiter**: given the shim-first one-file
probe's results it returns ``enter-loop``, ``degrade``, or ``ask-operator``
with a reason. A shim decline or a capture failure returns ``degrade``
unconditionally; an estimated round over budget with no other blocker returns
``ask-operator`` instead — a pure time estimate is not a hard blocker, so the
gate defers to the operator rather than degrading on its own. The agent runs
the probe (reusing the wrapper + #1157's capture detection) and feeds the
measurements here; applying the shim exclusions is #1159's job.

``ask-operator`` is also the arbiter's answer when the detector found
shim-breaking xunit.v3 constructs (#1791). That used to be a pure time-budget
question, which meant the operator's real decision — port, exclude, skip, or
degrade — was never presented anywhere; the shim was silently built, declined,
or degraded and they found out from a report, if at all. Feeding the detector's
findings in through ``ProbeResult.v3_blockers`` makes the same decision point
carry the per-construct breakdown plus those four options (built and rendered
by ``hooks/lib/xunit_v3_operator_gate.py``, so the guard hook and this gate
present one story).

Fail-closed on an omitted ``--v3-findings-json`` (#1870): every caller of this
CLI is, by the calling convention, already on an xunit.v3 project — "plain
xunit.v2 / other stacks skip this gate" per ``agents/mutation-kill.md``. Before
this fix, omitting the flag silently meant "no blockers" (``_load_v3_findings``
returned an empty tuple indistinguishable from "the detector ran and found
none"), so a caller that forgot to run the detector — or wired it up wrong —
got ``enter-loop`` with no operator question ever asked, the exact silent
decision #1791 exists to stop. ``ProbeResult.v3_findings_known`` (default
``True``, so direct ``decide()`` callers that already know their own
"no blockers" state are unaffected) is ``False`` only when the CLI itself
observed the flag was never supplied; :func:`decide` then forces
``ask-operator`` with a reason naming the missing detector run, combined with
the budget signal exactly like a real blocker set would be.

Version scope (#2184): this gate exists for Stryker.NET < 5.0.0. On a known
>= 5.0.0 install, ``stryker_xunit_shim_guard.py`` silent-passes before the
shim-first probe this arbiter consumes would ever run — ``-t mtp`` +
``coverage-analysis: perTest`` already gets per-test coverage directly on
xunit.v3 (stryker-net#3752), so there is no shim to probe, decline, or
degrade from. Running this gate's probe against a >= 5.0.0 install is
unnecessary work, not incorrect — the arbiter itself is unchanged; the
version gate simply means callers on a known >= 5.0.0 install should skip
invoking it in the first place.
