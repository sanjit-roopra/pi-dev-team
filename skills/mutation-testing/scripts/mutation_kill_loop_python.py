"""mutation_kill_loop_python.py — deterministic survivor-kill loop for
Python/mutmut, the Python counterpart to ``mutation_kill_loop.py`` (#1357).

mutmut has no project/solution structure to load from a config file the way
Stryker.NET does — a scoped run only needs the source file and a test
command, so there is no config-file abstraction here (unlike
``mutation_kill_loop.py``'s ``LoopConfig``/``stryker-config.json``). Scoring
and survivor extraction reuse ``mutation_report``'s mutmut-junitxml support
(#1357).

**Generation is a seam, not a mechanism** (same contract as the C# loop):
the loop never decides *what* tests to write — a caller supplies a
``generate`` callable that returns the new pytest function text. The
default (interactive) path is agent-driven: the ``mutation-kill`` agent
calls :func:`run_for_file` directly, passing a ``generate`` hook backed by a
live agent turn. A ``--headless`` CLI mode shells to ``claude --print`` for
unattended (CI) runs.

**Scope (#1583).** This module owns the scoped ``mutmut run``,
verify/commit/revert, and ``run_for_file`` orchestration — mirroring
``mutation_kill_loop.py``'s post-#1562 scope exactly. Insertion mechanics
(detect-or-refuse end-of-file test-function appending) live in
``mutation_kill_insert_python.py``, a stdlib-only leaf this module imports
from — never the reverse — mirroring the C# split
(``mutation_kill_insert.py``). Headless generation's shared ``claude --print``
invocation glue and the generic (non-language-specific) helpers
(``strip_code_fences``, ``resolve_model``, ``claude_cli_available``,
``CLAUDE_CLI``, ``run_claude_headless``) live in ``mutation_kill_shared.py``
(#1601) and are reused, not duplicated, here — only the Python-flavored
prompt (``build_generation_prompt``/``build_survivor_summary``) and the
``--headless`` CLI argument parsing for THIS loop stay local, since mutmut's
CLI args (``--test-command``, no ``--config``/``--stryker-bin``) genuinely
differ from the C# loop's.

**Shared mechanics (#1583).** ``_timeout_from_env``, ``git_revert``,
``git_reset_and_revert``, ``git_commit``, and the "no improvement across
rounds" stop predicate are imported from ``mutation_kill_shared.py`` rather
than defined here — they were byte-for-byte duplicated with
``mutation_kill_loop.py`` before that module existed.

**Import boundary (#1601).** ``resolve_model``, ``claude_cli_available``,
``CLAUDE_CLI``, and ``run_claude_headless`` are imported directly from
``mutation_kill_shared`` — never from ``mutation_kill_headless``, which is
the C#/Stryker.NET CLI module (it imports ``mutation_kill_loop`` at module
scope and owns the C#-only ``--config``/``--stryker-bin`` CLI surface).
(``strip_code_fences`` also moved to ``mutation_kill_shared`` but isn't
imported here directly — this module only reaches it indirectly, through
``run_claude_headless``'s own internal call.) Reaching into
``mutation_kill_headless`` for these language-neutral names used to
transitively pull the entire C# stack into this Python-only loop; importing
them from the neutral ``mutation_kill_shared`` module instead removes that
coupling entirely.

    file changed) is silently reused otherwise, which was a real trap hit
    manually while dogfooding this loop by hand (#1354): every run must see
    its own fresh baseline, not a leftover one.

    **Always reverts ``source_file`` (and ``test_file``, when given) in a
    ``finally``.** mutmut mutates the real source file on disk for the
    duration of each mutant's test run and restores it when that mutant
    finishes — but an internal mutmut crash (a real, reproducible one: mutmut
    2.5.1's own cache layer raises ``AssertionError``/``ValueError`` on some
    files, confirmed while dogfooding this exact function against
    ``hooks/mutation_adapters/mutmut.py`` — see #1357) skips that restore
    and leaves the mutated content on disk. Unlike Stryker.NET (which
    instruments a separate build, never the real file), mutmut's crash
    failure mode is "corrupt the file under test," so every scoped run must
    unconditionally `git checkout --` it afterward — succeeding, failing, or
    raising.

    The **test file** the ``--runner`` command exercises is exposed to the
    same failure mode — mutmut 2.5.1 has also been observed to truncate the
    runner's test file to empty via a crashed ``.bak``-restore (#1359),
    which silently breaks the *next* round's baseline (mutmut then reports
    zero mutants — a false "converged" positive, not real coverage). Passing
    ``test_file`` reverts it alongside ``source_file`` in the same
    ``finally``; each round's ``git checkout --`` restores exactly the
    state committed at the end of the previous round, which is always the
    correct baseline for the round about to run.

    **Lock-guarded end to end** (#1584): the cache delete, the mutmut run
    itself, and the revert are all held under ``.mutmut-cache.lock`` — not
    just the delete — because mutmut's cache is shared, fixed-path state for
    the whole repo; a second concurrent invocation reading/writing it
    mid-run is exactly as corrupting as racing the delete alone.

    Raises :class:`mutation_kill_shared.RevertFailed` when either cleanup
    revert fails. Both cleanup reverts are attempted first regardless of
    which one fails; the raised message names every file that failed to
    revert.
