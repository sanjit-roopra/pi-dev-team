"""mutation_kill_loop.py — config-driven, deterministic survivor-kill loop.

Migrated from the ACI ``nextgen-test-upgrade-process`` mutation agent and
de-hardcoded: nothing repo-specific lives here. Project / test-project /
mutate targets come from ``stryker-config.json``; ``DOTNET_ROOT`` resolution
and ``.sln`` hide/restore reuse the shipped ``csharp_stryker_net_wrapper``;
scoring and survivor extraction reuse ``mutation_report``.

Generic, stdlib-only, cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows). The only
non-stdlib imports are the sibling plugin modules in this same ``scripts/``
directory.

**Scope (#1562).** This module owns config parsing, the scoped Stryker run,
verify/commit/revert, and ``run_for_file`` orchestration. Insertion mechanics
(detect-or-refuse C# source manipulation) live in ``mutation_kill_insert.py``,
a stdlib-only leaf this module imports from — never the reverse — mirroring
the wrapper/report split already established by
``csharp_stryker_net_wrapper.py`` / ``mutation_report.py``. Headless
generation and the ``--headless`` CLI live in ``mutation_kill_headless.py``,
which is a different shape: a thin CLI layer built atop this module's public
API, so it imports back from here at module scope. This module only reaches
into it lazily, inside ``if __name__ == "__main__":``, specifically to avoid
the circular import that a module-scope import in both directions would
create.

**Shared mechanics (#1583).** ``_timeout_from_env``, ``git_revert``,
``git_reset_and_revert``, ``git_commit``, and the "no improvement across
rounds" stop predicate are imported from ``mutation_kill_shared.py`` rather
than defined here — they were byte-for-byte duplicated with
``mutation_kill_loop_python.py`` (the Python/mutmut sibling) before that
module existed. See its module docstring for the full rationale.

**Generation is a seam, not a mechanism.** The loop never decides *what*
tests to write — a caller supplies a ``generate`` callable that returns the
new test-method text. The default (interactive) path is agent-driven: the
``mutation-kill`` agent calls :func:`run_for_file` directly, passing a
``generate`` hook backed by a live agent turn. A ``--headless`` CLI mode
(``mutation_kill_headless.py``) shells to ``claude --print`` for unattended
(CI / shard-pipeline) runs. Invoking the CLI with neither an injected
generator nor ``--headless`` fails fast at startup — before any Stryker run
or file mutation.

    #2031: every file that converges pays one full scoped mutation run to
    learn it has converged, and that run generates nothing. The terminal
    round only needs to re-test the handful of mutants that survived the
    previous round, whose lines ``mutation_report.survivor_lines`` already
    computes.

    **Soundness invariant.** The mutation-kill loop never edits production
    source — every round only ever *adds* test methods to the test file
    (``apply_generated_methods`` / ``run_for_file``; ``mutation_kill_insert``
    refuses anything that looks like a source-file edit). So the set of
    mutation targets in ``source_file`` is fixed for the file's entire loop
    lifetime: no mutant can appear at a line outside the previous round's
    survivor set, because nothing the loop does between rounds can create
    one. That is what makes re-testing only the previous round's survivor
    lines a strictly narrower question with the same answer a full re-scan
    would give for those specific mutants, rather than merely a convenient
    shortcut.

    **Verified (#2031) — and the verification says this span form is
    WRONG.** Checked against Stryker.NET's own current documentation
    (stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/configuration/, § ``mutate``,
    fetched live during this work): the ``{start..end}`` span suffix on
    ``mutate`` (``dotnet stryker -m "File.cs{10..100}"``) is real and
    supported. But "a span is defined by the indices of the **first
    character** and the **last character**" — i.e. CHARACTER offsets into
    the file, not line numbers. The span form emitted below
    (``"**/File.cs{10..10}"`` for a survivor on line 10) feeds a *line*
    number into a slot Stryker parses as a *character* offset — it points at
    an unrelated, essentially arbitrary character range near the start of
    the file, not the intended line. Wiring this in as-is risks the exact
    "confirm-run that silently mutates more than it claims" failure this
    issue's Risk section warns against: at best the wrong span matches zero
    mutants (caught by ``_score_round``'s #1606 zero-mutants guard — see
    ``test_narrowed_confirm_config_resolving_to_nothing_still_trips_the_zero_mutants_guard``
    in ``tests/scripts/test_mutation_kill_loop_orchestration.py``); at worst
    it silently overlaps a *different* mutant than the one being confirmed.

    Translating a survivor line number into the character-offset span
    Stryker.NET actually expects is mechanically computable (read the file,
    sum preceding line lengths) — but the exact indexing convention (0- vs
    1-based, inclusive/exclusive end, how CRLF line endings count toward the
    offset) is not pinned by the documentation alone, and confirming it needs
    a live ``dotnet``/``dotnet-stryker`` run against a probe file with a
    known survivor line. No such toolchain is available in every environment
    that develops this plugin (checked: ``dotnet`` is not always on ``PATH``).
    Per this issue's own explicit fallback: **this function stays unwired**
    from ``_score_round`` — see
    ``test_confirm_scoped_config_is_not_wired_into_the_default_loop_path`` —
    until a pass with a real Stryker.NET verifies the character-offset
    conversion end-to-end. See ``references/languages/csharp-stryker-net.md``
    § "`--mutate` line-span narrowing" for the full recorded finding and what
    that verification pass needs to do.

    **Degenerate-narrowing guard (#2031 AC4).** When ``total_file_lines`` is
    supplied, narrowing that would touch ``degenerate_ratio`` or more of the
    file's own lines (default 50%) degrades to :func:`make_scoped_config`
    instead of emitting one span per line — re-testing most of a file one
    line at a time is no cheaper than re-scoping the whole file, and produces
    a far larger ``mutate`` array for no savings. ``total_file_lines=None``
    (the default) skips the comparison, matching today's unconditional
    per-line-span behavior for a caller that doesn't have the file's line
    count handy.

    Empty ``lines`` returns the ordinary whole-file scoped config, so a caller
    that finds no clustered survivors degrades to today's behavior rather than
    emitting a config that matches nothing.

    (``f"{config.solution}.stryker-hidden"``) with no validation — a
    traversal-shaped value (e.g. ``"../../etc/cron.d/evil"``) would let a
    hostile config target a file outside the repo if the config is ever read
    from an untrusted checkout (#1598). Resolves ``solution`` against
    ``cwd`` (or the current working directory) and rejects it unless the

    Callers must build ``sln``/``sln_hidden`` from THIS function's return

    the absolute path" as the name might suggest. The ``relative_to(base)``
    check below then rejects it as escaping, UNLESS the absolute value
    happens to already lie under ``base`` (a degenerate case with no
    practical use, since a relative value achieves the same result without
    depending on ``base``'s exact prefix). This narrows what a bare

    replaces ``generator_label`` for that commit AND every subsequent commit
    in this file (#1908 Step 3.2b) — the seam a model-downgrade event uses to
    record itself in the audit trail without mutating this frozen,
