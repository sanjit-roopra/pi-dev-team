"""stryker_shard_pipeline.py — sharded Stryker pipeline with timeout-abort.

Migrated from the ACI ``nextgen-test-upgrade-process`` ``stryker-pipeline.py``
and de-hardcoded: nothing repo-specific lives here. Shards are discovered from
``stryker-config.shard-*.json`` files (emitted by ``stryker_shard_setup.py``);
each shard runs Stryker through the shipped ``csharp_stryker_net_wrapper`` and
the per-shard survivor-fix loop is ``mutation_kill_loop`` forced into
``--headless`` mode (the pipeline is unattended — there is no live agent turn).

Compounding worktrees: shards are processed **sequentially**, each in its own
git worktree created from the current ``HEAD``. Because the survivor-fix loop
commits its fixes onto ``HEAD`` before the next shard's worktree is created,
the second shard's worktree already contains the first shard's committed fixes.

Timeout-abort: Stryker output is streamed through the wrapper's line-callback
(added in #1136 Slice 5.1). A ``"N mutants got status Timeout"`` line kills the
Stryker process and marks the shard failed — timeouts are non-deterministic
noise that would otherwise inflate the score, so we refuse to score them.

Generic, stdlib-only, cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows). The only
non-stdlib imports are the three sibling plugin modules in this same
``scripts/`` directory.

    Runs from ``repo_root`` so fixes commit onto ``HEAD`` — that is what makes
    the *next* shard's worktree compounding.

    Returns a :class:`FixOutcome`. ``ok`` is True when every launched fix
    exited zero or the dedicated GenerationExhausted exit code 5 (or none
    were launched); False the moment one exits any other non-zero code. The
    implementation does not distinguish the fatal-revert exit code 4
    (``mutation_kill_headless``/``mutation_kill_loop_python`` #1598) from any
    other non-zero, non-5 code — every such exit is treated identically as a
    failed revert, which means the working tree may be in an
    unknown/possibly-mutated state, so processing stops for the remaining
    files in this shard rather than silently continuing onto a tree that may
    already be broken. Exit code 4 is ``RevertFailed`` specifically — a
    failed revert. Exit code 5 covers two distinct outcomes that both map to
    the same code: true GenerationExhausted (a fully spent
    retry-then-downgrade budget) and any other clean RuntimeError (e.g. a
    generation timeout, or a mutmut/Stryker infrastructure failure — not
    exhaustion). Both are carved out from the fatal case: this file is
    logged as unfixed and the loop continues to the next file in the shard

    exhaustion contract that ```--all` continues``` (#1908 review) — but the

    the end if any file across any shard hit either outcome, unless a hard
    failure elsewhere makes it 1 (``main()``'s 3-branch priority: failed >
    exhausted/unresolved/no_report > clean).

    Two more outcomes, previously silently swallowed as a bare ``True`` (#1951):
    a survivor whose test file never resolves (``FixOutcome.unresolved``, one
    entry per such survivor — logged ``Agent SKIP: no test file resolved`` but
    the loop continues, since other survivors in the shard may still resolve)
    and a shard with no Stryker report at all (``FixOutcome.no_report``) —
    both now propagate to the run-level result instead of reading identically

      when ``launch_survivor_fix`` returns a :class:`FixOutcome` with

      one of three "a survivor was not addressed this run" outcomes fired

      fully spent retry-then-downgrade budget — or any other clean
      ``RuntimeError`` such as a generation timeout), ``unresolved`` is
      non-empty (a survivor whose test file never resolved), or
      ``no_report`` is non-empty (a shard Stryker produced no report for).
      All three previously read identically to a fully clean run; only
      ``exhausted`` got run-level visibility before this fix.
    - ``0`` — fully clean: no failures, no exhaustions, no unresolved test
      files, no missing reports. (``skipped`` shards — resumed past via
