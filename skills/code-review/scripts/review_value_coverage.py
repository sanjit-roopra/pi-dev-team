"""Validity check for the `review-value.jsonl` sample (#2019).

`review-value.jsonl` is the evidence base for every per-lens pruning or
tier-down decision (#1980, #1982, #1983, #2007). Both of its writers are
triggered by agent instruction rather than by mechanism — `/code-review`
rounds call `review_round_log.py` from a bash block in `SKILL.md`, and
`/build` checkpoints append the row by prose alone — so rows are collected
only when an agent remembers to collect them.

That failure is not uniform, and its direction is the problem. An agent that
found nothing is markedly less likely to run a "record the review value" step
than one that found something, so the rows that survive over-represent
productive rounds. #1512 measured exactly this and named it:

    ~100% "found something" on nearly every lens - because the only slices
    that got logged happened to have findings. This is a sampling artifact,
    not evidence a lens is valuable. Do not auto-prune yet.

Ten biased records were nearly used to prune lenses. This module exists so
that cannot happen silently again: it reconciles the value rows against the
dispatch ledger, which IS written deterministically by a hook, and reports
whether the sample can support a pruning decision at all.

## Why the ledger is a usable denominator

`agent_dispatch_ledger.py` writes one `boundary-events.jsonl` row per review
dispatch, carrying the agent name in `matched_rule`. It is a PostToolUse hook,
so it fires whether or not the round found anything - the exact property the
value stream lacks. Comparing the two gives a per-lens collection rate that no
amount of missing value rows can inflate.

The denominator is honest about its own limits: a dispatch the ledger missed
(hook disabled, older plugin version) is invisible here too, so coverage is an
upper bound on collection, never an under-estimate of the gap.

Stdlib-only. See docs/python-hook-contract.md.
