"""Finding identity across review rounds — the round ledger (#1625).

`/code-review`'s fix loop has an iteration cap but no notion of finding
*identity* across rounds: nothing can tell "this round found the same problem
again" from "this round found something genuinely new", so nothing can detect
that the loop is churning. #1619's case study ran 9 dispatch rounds over ~4
files, several of them re-verifying fixes to defects the previous round's fix
had introduced.

This module mirrors `/build`'s failure-signature dead-end detection (#864) —
the same normalize / compare / terminate pattern, applied to review findings —
and is the single shared implementation for both `/code-review`'s step 6a
loop and `/build`'s inline checkpoint loops.

## Why the line number is not inside the hash

The design sketch describes the signature as a tuple including a
"line-bucket ±3". A hashed bucket (`line // 7`) is *not* the same relation:
two reports of the same finding at lines 6 and 7 land in different buckets
and would read as two distinct findings, which is exactly the false-new
result the severity floor and loop-until-dry rules must not get. Proximity
is not an equivalence relation, so it cannot be folded into a hash without
introducing boundary artifacts.

So `signature()` hashes the *stable* identity — agent, file, category,
and the normalized message — and the line is carried alongside it in
`FindingKey`. `same_finding()` then applies the true ±`LINE_TOLERANCE`
proximity test. Callers that want one hashable key for set membership use
`FindingKey.signature`; callers deciding new-vs-carried use
`match_carried()`, which is the one that respects the tolerance.

## Message normalization

Volatile text is stripped before hashing so a finding re-reported after an
unrelated fix keeps its identity:

- line/column references (`:120:4`, `line 120`, `L120`)
- ISO-8601 timestamps
- hex digests of 7+ chars (commit shas, content hashes)
- quoted spans (`'x'`, `"x"`, `` `x` ``) — an identifier the fix renamed must
  not read as a different finding
- whitespace runs and letter case

Stdlib-only. See docs/python-hook-contract.md.
