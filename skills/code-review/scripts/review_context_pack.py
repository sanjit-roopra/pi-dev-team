"""One shared context pack for a review panel (#2006). OPT-IN, off by default.

**This is not the default dispatch path.** `code-review/SKILL.md` step 4 uses
the per-agent context payload unless the caller sets
`DEV_TEAM_REVIEW_CONTEXT_PACK=on`. ADR 0034 declined a shared-context pre-pass
after measuring duplicate full-file reads at 0.38%-4.86% of a round's total
input spend (median 0.8%); a later re-measurement with the same tool put it at
0.22%. The 4.31x multiplier quoted for this problem is a read-volume ratio, a
different denominator from the one that decision turns on. #2024 tracks
measuring panels of >= 8 agents, the shape that could change the answer.

The pack ships complete file bodies, not the structural skeleton ADR 0034
warned would starve line-level lenses, so it carries no known quality risk —
it simply has not been shown to pay for its complexity.

Every lens in a `/code-review` panel is handed the same changed files and then
reads them itself. Measured across 148 panels of >= 8 agents: **180 MB of Read
volume covering 41.8 MB of unique content — a 4.31x re-read multiplier**, with
one file opened by 38 agents in the worst case. Those panels are 73% of all
review spend.

The multiplier is not only cross-agent duplication. A lens that opens a file,
greps around it, and opens it again pays for it each time, and the panel pays
that per lens. What removes it is giving every lens the same prepared bytes
once, so reading is a single addressed fetch instead of an exploration.

## Why one pack serves nearly the whole panel

Of the 18 review lenses that declare a `Context needs` value, **17 need the
full bodies of the changed files** (13 `full-file`, 4 `project-structure`);
one needs the diff alone. So the union of what the panel needs is: the changed
file list, the diff, and the full bodies — which is exactly this pack. Each
lens reads the section its declaration calls for.

## What this deliberately does NOT do

It does not stop a lens from reading anything else. A lens tracing a caller
into an unchanged file still should, and still can. The pack removes the
*repeated* read of the *same* changed files, which is the measured cost; it is
not a sandbox.

## Truncation is always visible

A pack over its byte cap omits **whole files**, names every one of them in the
pack body and in the manifest, and tells the reader to open those directly.
Silently truncating would hand a lens a file that looks complete and is not —
a finding-shaped hole that reads as "reviewed". Per this repo's rule, a bound
that drops coverage says so out loud.
