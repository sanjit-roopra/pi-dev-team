"""Classify a changeset's shape to gate low-yield review lenses (#1254).

Running the full review panel unconditionally wastes tokens on diffs with no
runtime/logic surface. The 2026-07-20 audit found `performance-review` fired
0/10 and `correctness-review` 1/10 — on doc/config-dominated commits most lenses
no-op. `/code-review` (invoked directly) applies no complexity gate the way
`/build` and `/plan` do, so every lens runs on every changed file regardless of
change shape.

This module is the deterministic gate. Given the changed-file list it decides
whether the changeset has any **runtime surface** — a file that could hold
executable logic. When it does not (every file is documentation or config),
the two low-yield code lenses (`performance-review`, `correctness-review`) are
skipped; the rest of the panel still runs.

**Fail-safe by construction.** A file is "no runtime surface" only when it is
*provably* documentation or config (matches an explicit allowlist). Anything
else — an unknown extension, a source file, functional Claude-config markdown —
counts as runtime surface, so the lenses run. A misclassification can only ever
*add* a lens, never silently drop one on real code.

Pure policy — no filesystem, no globals. Mirrors the documentation-only
short-circuit's classification in `code-review/SKILL.md` (this gate is the
weaker sibling: the short-circuit skips *everything* when every file is
documentation; this skips only the two low-yield lenses when every file is
documentation *or* config, which the doc-only short-circuit does not cover).

Test-only classification (#1964)
--------------------------------
This module answers a second, independent question: is *every* changed file
provably a test file (per `knowledge/test-file-indicators.md`)? A diff of that
shape is structurally incapable of exhibiting what several expensive lenses
look for — and under `/test-improve`'s default `refactor-mode: no-refactor`,
Phase 5's diff is *guaranteed* to have it, because `/build` rejects
production-code changes in that mode.

`testOnly` is reported but currently skips **nothing**: `TEST_ONLY_SKIP_LENSES`
ships empty on purpose. Which lens is safe to drop on a test-only diff is an
empirical question, and the evidence (per-lens outcomes split by `diff_shape`
in `review-value.jsonl`) is still being collected. This mirrors the
architectural-impact gate's own rule — "widen `GATED_LENSES` from #1624's
measured per-agent data, not from intuition about which lens probably no-ops."
Two lenses in particular must NOT be added without data: `security-review`
(tests embed credentials and injection payloads) and `correctness-review`
(an inverted assertion is precisely its subject).

Test-only classification is **include-biased in the same direction** as the
runtime-surface check: a changeset is test-only only when every file is
*provably* a test. Anything unproven — a fixture, a `conftest.py`, a helper, a
`.cs` file whose test-ness needs its contents — makes the answer `False`, so
the full panel runs. Because this module is filesystem-free by contract, the
content-probing branches of the shared classifier are deliberately starved
(`content=""`), which can only ever move the answer toward "not test-only".

Scope note: this is a filename-shape gate. Annotation-only edits *inside* a
source file (e.g. adding a C# attribute) still count as runtime surface — that
would require diff parsing and is deliberately out of scope for v1.

Shared literal tables (#1477): the documentation-extension, doc-root-word,
and functional-config-name/segment literals below are byte-identical to
`hooks/pre_commit_review.py`'s own doc-only classifier and were previously
hand-duplicated between the two, kept in sync only by comment convention.
They now live in `hooks/lib/doc_classification.py`, imported here via the
same `sys.path.insert` cross-boundary pattern `pre_commit_review.py` already
uses for its own `hooks/lib/` imports — see that module's docstring for why
this location was chosen and why the *matching logic* (prefix vs. exact
match) intentionally stays local to each caller rather than being unified
too.
