"""Architectural-impact gate for expensive structural lenses.

`arch-review` is `Scope: always` and opus-tier: it runs on every non-empty
changeset, including diffs that cannot possibly exhibit what it looks for.
Its declared scope is ADR compliance, **layer boundary violations**,
**dependency direction**, and pattern consistency — all of which are
properties of a codebase's *structure*. A diff that adds a guard clause
inside an existing function, with no import change, no new or moved file, no
manifest edit, and no public-interface change, has not moved any boundary
for it to evaluate.

This is the third gate in the same family, applied after the existing two
(`select_lenses.py`'s `Scope:` eligibility, then `change_shape.py`'s
runtime-surface gate, then `change_size.py`'s diff-size gate). It narrows by
*architectural signal* rather than by file type or diff size.

## Fail-safe, and deliberately include-biased

Any file this module cannot classify, any diff it cannot parse, and any empty
input all count as architectural impact and keep every lens. The gate can only
ever remove a lens it can prove has nothing to look at. Mirrors
`change_shape.py`'s own fail-safe posture — see that module.

## Which lenses are gated, and why

Two, on the same test: the lens's subject must be *provably absent* from the
diff, not merely unlikely to appear in it.

- `arch-review` — its subject is structure, so a diff with no structural
  signal (below) has moved no boundary for it to evaluate.
- `concurrency-review` (#1975) — its subject is races, async ordering,
  idempotency, and shared-state safety, none of which can arise where no
  concurrency primitive appears in the diff's added, removed, **or context**
  lines. The context lines are load-bearing in that sentence: a body-only
  edit adding `self._counter += 1` inside an existing locked block carries no
  primitive of its own, and an earlier draft of this gate dropped the lens on
  exactly that diff — the shape most likely to introduce a race. Scanning the
  hunk's context closes it for any primitive within the diff's context
  window; a shared-state mutation whose only synchronization lives further
  away than that window is the residual limit, recorded here rather than
  claimed away.

`domain-review` is the obvious next candidate and is deliberately NOT gated
here. Its scope includes "business logic placement", and putting business
logic into a controller method body is a real domain violation introduced by
a *body-only* edit with no structural signal at all — exactly the diff shape
this gate would skip. Gating it would create a silent coverage hole.

The same evidence-first discipline `verification-mode.md` applies to
tier-down opt-ins applies here: gate the one lens whose scope is
unambiguously structural, record the skip (`review-value.jsonl`'s
`dispatch_purpose`/agent split, #1624), and let measured data authorize
widening `GATED_LENSES` — not intuition about which lens "probably" no-ops.

Stdlib-only. See docs/python-hook-contract.md.

#: catches the single most common Python form — `with self._lock:` — that a
#: leading `\b` cannot match (the char before `lock` is `_`, itself a word
