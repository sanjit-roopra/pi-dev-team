"""Closing-pass composition for `/code-review`'s fix loop (#1626).

`/code-review` step 6a used to mandate: after ANY fix-loop iteration ran,
re-dispatch the **full** original agent panel once more against the final
staged content. The reason was structural, not editorial — the pre-commit
gate (#1461) needed `>= 2` distinct dispatches whose `subject_hash` equals the
FINAL staged hash, and the loop's targeted re-dispatches only cover the
agents that happened to have findings. So a one-line fix re-triggered an
18-agent panel. That is the single biggest cost multiplier in the loop, and
#1619 paid it repeatedly.

This module computes the **closing pass** instead: the minimal dispatch set
that preserves both properties the full re-panel was defending.

## The two properties, and how each is preserved

1. **The gate's corroboration floor, satisfied by construction.**
   `hooks/pre_pr_review.py`'s `_MIN_DISTINCT_DISPATCHES` is 1 (#2147; lowered
   from 2 — a single `/code-review` dispatch already runs a full panel
   internally, so a second top-level dispatch was never additional
   corroboration). The composition rule below tops up from the resolver's
   eligible roster until at least that many distinct registered agents
   dispatch at the final hash. No hook change, no exemption event, no ledger
   change — the floor is met the same way it is met today, just with 1-2
   dispatches instead of 18 (previously 2-3, under the old floor of 2).

2. **Not a rubber stamp.** Closing-pass agents keep full review authority:
   any actionable finding re-enters the fix loop exactly as before (subject
   to #1625's round cap). What changes is *how many* agents re-read *how
   much* content — never whether their findings count. A pass whose findings
   carried no consequence would be exactly the "dispatch trivial calls purely
   to clear the gate" abuse `pre_commit_review.py`'s own docstring names.

## Scope: the fix delta, not the whole changeset

The round-1 panel already reviewed the full changeset. Only the *fix delta*
— what changed between what the panel reviewed and the final staged content
— is unreviewed. The closing pass reviews that delta.

**Escape hatch.** If the fix delta touches files the original panel never
targeted, scope grew mid-loop and the delta-only argument no longer holds:
fall back to the full re-dispatch over the whole changeset. That condition is
a deterministic set-comparison of two file lists, checked here rather than
judged in prose.

Stdlib-only. See docs/python-hook-contract.md.
