"""Deterministic pre-pass for repo-specific "every X has a Y" invariants (#1608).

`/code-review`'s final panel round on PR #1600 independently rediscovered the
same mechanically-checkable fact in four separate agent dispatches
(`doc-review`, `structure-review`, `ai-provenance-review`, `test-review`):
a newly-added script module under a `scripts/` directory had no corresponding
row in its skill's own documentation. That shape — "every module under
SCRIPTS_DIR should be named at least once in its skill's docs" — is a glob
check, not a semantic judgment call, but nothing stopped the full panel from
re-deriving it once per agent per round.

This module is a small, growable registry of such checks. Each check takes an
optional `changed_files` list (repo-relative paths for this review's
changeset, or `None` for "check everything") and returns a list of finding
dicts:

    {"invariant": <str>, "file": <repo-relative str>, "message": <str>}

`changed_files` exists because some invariants are **required going forward
but explicitly not retrofitted** — the `_calibration` convention in
`evals/README.md` is the motivating case ("Required for every NEW fixture
going forward. Do not retrofit the ~140 existing fixtures — that is pure
churn with no discovered provenance to record"). Scoping such a check to the
changeset enforces it on exactly the fixtures being authored right now, which
is also where #1629 wants it: the author gets the finding **before** round 1
instead of from it. A check that applies corpus-wide simply ignores the
argument.

**Not Python-specific — a check operates on whatever file types the
invariant it's proving is about.** The one shipped here happens to walk a
directory that is entirely `.py` today only because this repo's own shipped
scripts are Python-only by convention (ADR 0014/0015); the glob itself
matches every file in that directory regardless of extension, and a future
check is free to target `.ts`/`.cs`/`.java`/`.go`/anything else this repo or
a downstream project's own conventions call for — `/code-review` runs
against projects in every language this plugin supports (see
`skills/static-analysis-integration/references/tool-configs.md`'s
per-language tool tiers), so new checks should not assume a Python target
just because the first one did. Add new checks by writing a function and
appending it to `CHECKS` below. Start narrow — this ships with exactly one
check (mutation-testing scripts documented) — and expand opportunistically
as more "N agents rediscovered the same mechanical fact" cases turn up (see
the issue for the intended pattern).

Wired into `/code-review` step 2b (see `skills/code-review/SKILL.md`):
findings are injected into agent context the same way static-analysis
findings already are — "detected by static analysis, do not re-report,
focus on semantic concerns" — so agents stop spending tokens re-deriving
facts this script already proved.

Stdlib-only. See docs/python-hook-contract.md.

    agents (`doc-review`, `structure-review`, `ai-provenance-review`,

    documentation row. It shipped covering `mutation-testing` alone.

    `skills/code-review/scripts/` had gained `review_value_coverage.py` (from
    #2020) with no mention in its own skill's docs. Under this repo's ratchet
    rule a twice-reported mechanical class becomes a check, so the hardcoded
    single-skill form became this registry.

    Matches every file regardless of extension — these directories happen to
    be all-Python today (ADR 0014/0015), but "every module is documented" is
    language-agnostic and must keep holding if a differently-extensioned file

    is a standing gap whether or not this changeset touched it, and the whole

# --- #2048: a second transcript parser must not reappear -------------------
#
# ADR 0036 records that both `structure-review` and `arch-review` raised the
# same duplication independently while reviewing #1991 -- two scripts each
# carrying their own copy of transcript-record and usage-block parsing,
# already drifted twice on the same defect class (#1990/#1991/#1994).
# Epic #2040 unified both into `session_log/` + one entry point
# (`session_report.py`). This check is the ratchet that keeps a THIRD
# independent copy from growing back once the two originals are gone.

#: Any file outside `plugins/dev-team/scripts/lib/session_log/` that
#: references one of these identifiers is either genuinely parsing a raw
#: transcript record / usage block (a real second implementation) or reading
#: an already-extracted usage dict's known numeric fields (not the same
#: failure mode) -- `_TRANSCRIPT_PARSING_ALLOWLIST` below distinguishes the
#: two per-file, with a reason each. `cache_creation_input_tokens` and
#: `cache_read_input_tokens` are usage-block field names; `isSidechain` and
#: `attributionAgent` are raw-record top-level fields no usage-only consumer
#: would ever need, so their presence is the stronger of the two signals.
_TRANSCRIPT_FIELD_RE = re.compile(
    r"\b(cache_creation_input_tokens|cache_read_input_tokens|isSidechain|attributionAgent)\b"
)

#: Directories (repo-root-relative) this check scans -- everywhere a
#: transcript-parsing module has actually turned up historically (the
#: shipped plugin tree, and the monorepo's own repo-root `scripts/`, where
#: `measure_full_file_duplication.py` and the eval/experiment harnesses
#: live). Repo-root `tests/` is deliberately not a scan root: fixture
#: literals constructing synthetic usage dicts are not "parsing," and
#: scanning them would bury the real findings in noise.
_TRANSCRIPT_SCAN_ROOTS = ("plugins/dev-team", "scripts")

#: Shrink-only (docs/adr/0032's "mechanically, not by comment alone"
#: pattern, mirrored here for #2048's invariant). Each entry states WHY the
#: match is not the failure mode this check targets. Two shapes:
#:   - "the sanctioned entry point" -- composes session_log's own shared
#:     primitives rather than reimplementing them independently;
#:   - "reads a pre-extracted usage dict" -- consumes a `usage` mapping a
#:     caller already extracted (a handful of known numeric field names),
#:     never a raw transcript record (no isSidechain/attributionAgent
#:     access) -- a materially different, much narrower concern than
#:     parsing a transcript.
#: A "migrated in #2050" entry is a real, temporary exception: that slice's
#: job is to fold it onto session_log.records and delete it from this list.

    `boundary_events_write_guard.py`'s own import), reported by 4 of 8
    reviewers (arch, domain, naming, structure) — clearing this repo's own
    ratchet rule ("a mechanical finding reported twice becomes a check")
    decisively. `review_dispatch_ledger.LEDGER_STREAM` is now an alias of
    `boundary_events.LOG_NAME`, not a fresh literal — this check asserts
    that stays an *identity*, not just an equal value, so a future edit
    can't silently reintroduce a fourth independent copy with a green test
    suite.

    Corpus-wide by design: this is a standing structural invariant, not a
    changeset-scoped one.
