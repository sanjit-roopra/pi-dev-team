# Code Review

**The review-agent panel is the primary quality gate** (Rec 5,
`docs/experiments/RECOMMENDATIONS.md`). The review-agent lens — SRP,
complexity, coupling, duplication — was the only quality axis that separated
workflow arms in the experiment line. Coverage and mutation scores saturate
near-identically across every workflow shape and must **never** be used to
rank workflow quality: the losing big-batch and split arms posted *higher*
mutation scores (0.93–0.98) than the two winners (0.80–0.86). A higher
coverage or mutation number is not evidence that code — or the workflow that
produced it — is better. (The deterministic static-analysis pre-pass below is
a different, complementary axis: mechanical findings cleared before the
semantic panel runs, not a metric competing with it.)

Role: orchestrator. Route work to review agents; do not review code yourself. Pass each agent's `model:`/`effort:` frontmatter as declared when dispatching — the harness resolves both fields natively before dispatch, per Model/Effort Resolution in `agents/orchestrator.md` (ADR 0026).

Output templates and JSON schemas: [`output-format.md`](output-format.md). Example report: [`examples/sample-report.md`](examples/sample-report.md).

## Orchestrator constraints

**MUST — confirm agent-dispatch capability before anything else in this skill (issue #1461).** Before attempting to dispatch ANY review agent (Step 4), you MUST confirm the `Agent` (or `Task`) tool is actually present and available in your current toolset. If it is not present: **STOP.** Do not proceed with a self-applied, inline, or checklist-based review of any kind as a substitute for independent dispatch — an orchestrator applying the review agents' checklists itself is not a review, it is self-certification, and it defeats the entire purpose of this gate. Do not write `.pr-review-passed` under any circumstance in this state. Instead, report to the user/operator plainly: code review cannot run in this environment because no agent-dispatch capability (`Agent`/`Task` tool) is available; name exactly what's missing; and state that the PR gate cannot be satisfied until `/code-review` is re-run from a session that has that capability. This is a hard requirement, not a preference — "should dispatch agents" is not sufficient; a missing `Agent`/`Task` tool always halts this skill before Step 2.

1. **Do not review code yourself.** Delegate all semantic analysis to review agents.
2. **Minimize context per agent.** Pass only what each agent's `Context needs` field requires.
3. **Route to the right model.** Each agent's `model:`/`effort:` frontmatter declares its model alias and reasoning effort; the harness resolves both fields natively before dispatch, per `agents/orchestrator.md` → Model/Effort Resolution (ADR 0026). Do not override the frontmatter value.
4. **Run deterministic gates first.** Lint, type-check, secret scan are cheaper than AI. Stop if they fail.
5. **Return structured results.** Aggregate agent JSON; do not add your own findings.
6. **Be concise.** Tables and JSON, no preambles, no filler.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

| Flag | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--agent <name>` | Run only the named agent (delegates to `/review-agent`) |
| `--since <ref>` | Review files changed since the ref — see step 1 for the exact command (the `-c diff.relative=false -c core.quotePath=false` overrides there are load-bearing, not cosmetic) |
| `--path <dir>` | Review only files in this directory |
| `--all` | Force full-repository review even when uncommitted changes exist |
| `--slice <N>` | Engage sliced large-repo review explicitly, capping each slice at N files (module-aligned) at any repo size. `N` must be a positive integer. See [`sliced-mode.md`](sliced-mode.md). |
| `--resume` | Resume a sliced run — skip slices whose section artifact already exists on disk. See [`sliced-mode.md`](sliced-mode.md). |
| `--no-slice` | Escape hatch — force the legacy single-pass review even on a large full-repo scope that would otherwise auto-engage sliced mode. |
| `--json` | Output aggregated JSON to **stdout** instead of prose. Contractually non-interactive (for CI): never prompts; defaults to report-only (no code modified). |
| `--expand <finding-id>|all` | Prose-mode only (step 7): render Tier-2 (full message + suggested fix) for the named finding-id, or for every finding with `all`, after the Tier-1 report — see step 7. A no-op under `--json` (see step 7's `--json` branch). **Only meaningful within the SAME run that computed the ids** — pass it alongside `--since`/`--path`/etc. in one invocation once you already know a specific id, e.g. because the operating Claude session read the prior Tier-1 output and is now re-invoking this skill with the same scope plus `--expand <id>` still in the same conversation; that path never re-dispatches anything beyond what the scope would have dispatched anyway. A cold, separate `/code-review --expand <id>` run with no memory of where that id came from IS a full re-dispatch of the panel (steps 1-6 run in full, same as any other invocation) and the id is not guaranteed to still exist or mean the same finding — `render_tiered_findings.py`'s own docstring says ids are not stable across runs. `--expand` never triggers a SECOND panel dispatch on top of an already-running one; it only changes step 7's rendering of the one panel a given invocation already ran. |
| `--pdf` | After the durable report is written, also render it to a sibling PDF via `hooks/lib/report_pdf.py`. See `knowledge/report-pdf-integration.md`. No-op with a message when no report file is written (`--json` or `--internal`); under `--json`, that status goes to **stderr** so stdout stays pure JSON. Additive: never changes the review's own output or exit status. |
| `--internal` | This is an orchestrator-internal dispatch (`/build`'s Step 6 backstop review, `/test-improve`'s Phase 4/5 end-of-phase review loop) — skip the `.dev-team-reports/code-review.md` report write in step 7. Orthogonal to `--json`: `--internal` alone still runs the prose/fix-loop path; both sanctioned callers use `--internal` without `--json` specifically to keep the fix loop. `/build` and `/test-improve` are the only sanctioned callers of this flag today — see `knowledge/report-output-location.md` for `/ship`'s deliberate exception (writes the report by default, no `--internal`). |
| `--init-risks` | Scaffold `ACCEPTED-RISKS.md` from `templates/ACCEPTED-RISKS.md.tmpl` if absent. Exits non-zero without overwriting if present. Schema: `knowledge/accepted-risks-schema.md`. |
| `--force` | Skip pre-flight gates **and the documentation-only short-circuit** (forces a full review of doc-only changes). **Requires `--reason "<text>"`** — logged to `.claude/metrics/override-audit.jsonl`. |
| `--reason "<text>"` | Override justification (required with `--force`) |
| `--static-analysis` / `--no-static-analysis` | Force on/off the static analysis pre-pass (Semgrep, ESLint, TypeScript, Ruff, mypy). Auto-enabled when tools are detected. |
| `--background` | Drift review mode — review default branch for documentation, naming, and structural drift. Runs doc-review, arch-review, naming-review, structure-review only. Skips pre-flight gates. |
| (no flags) | **Auto-scope**: review uncommitted changes if any exist, otherwise full repository |

## Steps

### 1. Determine target files

Priority order:

1. `--path <dir>` — files in that directory (exclude node_modules, .git, dist, build, coverage)
2. `--since <ref>` — `git -c diff.relative=false -c core.quotePath=false diff --name-only <ref>...HEAD`
3. `--all` — all source files
4. **Auto-scope** (no flags): run `git -c diff.relative=false -c core.quotePath=false diff --name-only` + `git -c diff.relative=false -c core.quotePath=false diff --cached --name-only`, combine and dedupe. If non-empty, review those files. If empty, review the full repository. The explicit `-c diff.relative=false` matters here (#1461 fourth security re-review): a repo/global `diff.relative=true` config would otherwise silently scope this listing to the invocation's cwd, and `review_gate_hash()`/`_staged_names()` (which pin the same override) would then hash/gate a broader staged patch than what was actually reviewed. `-c core.quotePath=false` (#1733) keeps this listing byte-identical to step 3's `changed_file_list.py` input for the same ref/scope — without it, a non-ASCII path would arrive C-quoted here but raw there, and `select_lenses.py`'s `--added` membership test (an exact string comparison) would silently fail to match it.

**Stage auto-scoped changes now, before anything else (#1461).** When the auto-scope path found a non-empty file set, `git add` those files immediately — before pre-flight gates, static analysis, or any agent dispatch — so the staged content's hash is fixed from this point through step 9's gate write. This is not cosmetic: `agent_dispatch_ledger.py` stamps each review-agent dispatch's `subject_hash` with `review_gate_hash()` at **dispatch time** (step 4). If staging happened only at step 9 (after dispatch) as previously documented, the dispatch-time hash and the gate-write-time hash would differ whenever the auto-scope target was unstaged — the common case — and every genuine dispatch would silently fail to corroborate the gate, forcing a hard block on a fully legitimate review. Staging here, before dispatch, is what makes step 9's hash and the dispatch ledger's `subject_hash` the same value. An unstaged working-tree edit after this point does **not** by itself change the staged hash (`review_gate_hash()` hashes `git diff --cached`, not the working tree) — step 6a's fix loop explicitly re-stages (`git add`) each iteration's fixes for exactly this reason; see that step for how corroboration is re-established after a fix loop runs.

**Never `Read` a directory path directly to enumerate its contents** — `Read` on a directory throws `EISDIR` (the same hazard step 3 avoids for agent-roster enumeration). This applies to `--path <dir>`, `--all`, and the full-repository fallback alike: always list files with `Glob` (e.g. `Glob("<dir>/**/*")`), never a bare `Read` on the directory itself. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/directory-enumeration.md` for the shared rule.

**Scope validation** (full-repo paths only):

| File count | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ≤200 | Proceed |
| 201–500 | Warn: "Reviewing {N} files — consider `--path` to narrow scope." Proceed. |
| >500 | **Auto-engage sliced mode** (large-repo review) unless `--no-slice`. |

**Sliced large-repo review.** On a full-repo scope exceeding the >500 tier (or
whenever `--slice <N>` is passed), **auto-engage sliced mode**: run the sliced
path in [`sliced-mode.md`](sliced-mode.md) instead of steps 4–9 below. That file
owns the full activation precedence (via `scripts/activation.py`), partitioning,
per-slice panels, persist-and-drop, `--resume`, and cross-slice consolidation —
not restated here. `--no-slice` forces the legacy single-pass review (steps 2–9)
even past the threshold; Exactly at 500 files does not auto-engage.
**Non-full-repo scope** (`--path`, `--since`, auto-scoped uncommitted changes)
**never** auto-engages, regardless of file count — the review proceeds exactly
as before this feature. Sliced mode is **report-only** (no interactive fix loop).

**Documentation-only short-circuit.** After the target set is known, classify each file. A file is **documentation** when it matches a doc type or path:

- extension `.md`, `.mdx`, `.markdown`, `.rst`, `.txt`, `.adoc`
- any path under a `docs/` directory
- a root doc: `README*`, `CHANGELOG*`, `CONTRIBUTING*`, `LICENSE*`, `NOTICE*`, `AUTHORS*`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT*`

…**except functional Claude-config markdown, which is never documentation** (it drives agent/skill/command behavior and must be reviewed): any path containing a `.claude/` segment, or under `agents/`, `skills/`, `prompts/`, `knowledge/`, or `templates/agents/`. Treat `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` as functional config too, not documentation.

If **every** target file is documentation, short-circuit:

1. Emit: `Documentation-only changeset ({N} files) — skipping code review. Re-run with --force --reason "<text>" to review anyway.`
2. If the review was auto-scoped to uncommitted changes or scoped via `--since <base>` (issue #1904 Bug 2b — same extension as step 9's own gate condition, and for the same reason: `/pr`'s only path to `gh pr create` reviews via `--since <base>`), write the `.pr-review-passed` gate file (per step 9) so `hooks/pre_pr_review.py` allows the next `gh pr create`. **Contemporaneously** (before or immediately after that write), record the doc-only exemption as an explicit, auditable boundary event — the `.pr-review-passed` gate's dispatch-ledger corroboration (#1461, #1886) reads this event, bound to the gate's own hash, to let the doc-only path stay exempt from agent-dispatch evidence without being a silent, unaccountable code-path skip:
   ```bash
   HASH=$(python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/lib/review_gate_hash.py" --branch-diff)
   mkdir -p .claude/memory && echo "$HASH" > .claude/memory/.pr-review-passed
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/lib/boundary_events.py" --event doc-only --subject-hash "$HASH"
   ```
3. In `--json` mode, emit `{"status": "skipped", "reason": "documentation-only", "files": [<list>]}` instead.
4. **Stop.** Do not run pre-flight gates, static analysis, or any agent.

**Bypass:** the short-circuit does **not** apply with `--force` (with `--reason`), `--agent <name>`, or `--background` (drift review always inspects docs).

### 1b. Check for institutional context

If `REVIEW-CONTEXT.md` exists at the repo root, read it and pass its contents to every agent in step 4, prefixed with: "Institutional context provided for this review:". This file is optional.

### 1c. Probe for optional MCP tools

| Tool | Check | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RoslynMCP | `get_code_metrics` / `search_symbols` available | C# metrics, compiler diagnostics |
| CodeGraph | `.codegraph/` present / `mcp__codegraph__codegraph_explore` available | Verified structural skeletons, resolved callers/callees/impact |
| Repowise | `get_context` / `get_symbol` / `search_codebase` / `get_risk` available | Verified file/symbol context + modification-risk lookups |
| Documentation MCP | wiki/docs search available | Architecture docs |
| Semgrep | `which semgrep` | SAST context for security-review |

Pass availability info to each agent so they can use enhanced tools or fall back to Glob/Grep/Read. All read-only review agents grant these MCP tools; see [`knowledge/codegraph-vs-graphify.md`](../../knowledge/codegraph-vs-graphify.md) for tool selection and the fallback contract. Include availability in the final report per `knowledge/review-template.md`.

### 2. Pre-flight gates

Skip entirely if `--background`. If `--force` without `--reason`, halt:

```
ERROR: --force requires --reason "<justification>".
```

If `--force` with `--reason`, append an entry to `.claude/metrics/override-audit.jsonl` per the schema in [`output-format.md`](output-format.md#override-audit-log-entry-step-2---force-path), then proceed to step 3.

Otherwise run these in sequence (stop on first failure):

1. **Lint**: `npx eslint` (or project lint command) on target files.
2. **Type check**: `npx tsc --noEmit` if `tsconfig.json` exists.
3. **Secret scan** (#1977). Prefer the purpose-built scanner when it is installed, and keep the grep as the zero-dependency fallback — this gate is the one place a committed credential must hard-stop the review, and it was checking a single regex while a real secrets scanner already ran one step later in the pre-pass:
   - If `command -v gitleaks` succeeds, run it with the **canonical invocation** in [`skills/static-analysis-integration/references/tool-configs.md`](../static-analysis-integration/references/tool-configs.md) § gitleaks — one documented command, not a variant of it (`--no-verify` is what keeps it fully offline). Any finding on a target file → **fail the gate**. Report the rule id and `file:line` only; **never echo the matched secret value** into the report or transcript. Record that gitleaks ran, and **do not run it again in step 2b** — same "do not run Semgrep twice" rule.
   - Otherwise (gitleaks absent): grep target files for the runnable pattern in [`knowledge/owasp-detection.md`](../../knowledge/owasp-detection.md) § Hardcoded-key pattern (the fenced code block, not the table row — table cells escape `|` as `\|`, a literal pipe rather than alternation). Note in the report that the fallback ran, so a reader can tell "no secrets found by gitleaks" apart from "no secrets found by one regex".
4. **Semgrep SAST**: `semgrep scan --config auto --quiet --json` on target files if installed. ERROR-severity → fail. WARNING-severity → continue, include in report. Save findings for security-review context.
5. **Pipeline-red check**: `gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 1 --json conclusion -q '.[0].conclusion'` if `gh` is available. If the last CI run failed, warn: "Pipeline is red. Fix CI before adding new code. Use `--force` to override."

Skip any gate silently if its tool is unavailable.

### 2b. Static analysis pre-pass

Skip if `--no-static-analysis` or `--background`.

Follow the detection, execution, and deduplication procedure in [`skills/static-analysis-integration/SKILL.md`](../static-analysis-integration/SKILL.md). Output is structured findings injected into agent context in step 4. **This step does not gate execution** — it collects context only.

**Growing this registry is a rule, not a discretion (#1981).** When any review agent reports the same mechanically-checkable finding class for the **second** time, and the check is expressible as a deterministic script, it becomes a `CHECKS` entry in `scripts/repo_invariants.py` **in the same PR that fixes the finding**. Two occurrences make it a class; converting there turns an unbounded stream of re-derivations into one bounded conversion. The root `CLAUDE.md` Working Rules state the same rule — it applies to this repo's own development, and the mechanism ships for downstream projects to use the same way.

**Repo-specific invariant pre-pass (#1608).** Also run:

```bash
python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/repo_invariants.py" --files <target files>
```

It checks a small, growable list of this repo's own "every X should have
exactly one corresponding Y" invariants — mechanically checkable facts a full
agent panel would otherwise re-derive independently, once per agent, every
round. Its `findings` array merges into step 4's static-analysis context using
the same envelope and the same "detected by static analysis — do not
re-report, focus on semantic concerns" framing. Expand `CHECKS` in that script
as more rediscovered-N-times cases turn up; this step never needs to change to
pick up a new check.

**Internal-collaborator-doubling pre-pass (#2130).** Also run:

```bash
python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/test-design/scripts/internal_double_detector.py" . --files <target files> --json
```

Detects an unwaived (or malformed/invalid-blocker-waiver) double of a
project first-party collaborator, per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/internal-collaborator-doubling.md`. Same
`<target files>` list as the `repo_invariants.py` block above — one
scoping mechanism for both tools in this step, not two. Its `findings`
array merges into step 4's static-analysis context using the same envelope
and the same "detected by static analysis — do not re-report, focus on
semantic concerns" framing. This step does not gate on the finding — it
collects context only, exactly like every other check in this step; the
actual gate is the `hooks/internal_double_gate.py` PreToolUse hook plus
the required `"Plugin content & hooks"` CI check (#2128). `test-review` and
`test-smell-review` cite this pre-pass's finding rather than re-deriving
it when it's present (see
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/test-review-division-of-labor.md`).

**Test-review mechanical pre-phase (#2169).** Also run, for each test file in `<target files>`:

```bash
python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/test_review_mechanics.py" . <file>
```

Only relevant when `test-review` is in the dispatched lens set for this
round; skip entirely otherwise. Unlike the two pre-passes above, this one
runs **once per file** rather than once over the whole `<target files>`
list, because `test-review.md`'s own Phase 0 (`agents/test-review.md` →
Protocol) needs each file's own `mechanicalFail`/findings result supplied as
that file's context — the agent has no `Bash` tool and never runs this
script itself. Keep the per-file results keyed by file path when assembling
step 4's context so each file's `test-review` dispatch gets its own result,
not the whole batch's. Pass each result to `test-review` as its Phase 0
input using `agents/test-review.md`'s own framing ("detected by static
analysis, do not re-derive" — the agent still reports it as this file's own
finding when `mechanicalFail` is true, per that file's Phase 0 bullets) —
**not** the generic "detected by static analysis — do not re-report, focus
on semantic concerns" envelope the two pre-passes above use for every other
agent. That generic framing is correct for `repo_invariants.py`/
`internal_double_detector.py`'s findings, which every dispatched agent
receives as already-covered context to fold silently into a semantic
review; it would be wrong here, since `test-review` is this pre-pass's
sole intended reporter, not one of several agents absorbing someone else's
finding.

**Pass `--files` (#1629).** Several checks are scoped to the changeset,
because the conventions they enforce are "required going forward, do not
retrofit" (`evals/README.md`'s `_calibration` rule is the motivating case).
Without `--files` those checks stay silent rather than reporting the ~150
pre-existing findings the conventions explicitly do not require fixing. The
`--all` flag exists for deliberate backlog triage and must **not** be used
here.

**Authoring-time ordering (#1629).** When *writing* fixtures or agent files,
run this same command at edit time, before the first panel dispatches — same
command, earlier. Of #1619's 8 follow-up rounds, at least 4 were triggered by
defect classes these deterministic checks catch, plus factually wrong
runtime-semantics claims that `evals/README.md`'s **executable-claims
convention** requires verifying by execution at authoring time. A claim the
author has already run is a claim the panel reviews as evidence rather than
adjudicates from scratch.

If Semgrep already ran in the pre-flight gate, reuse those findings. Do not run Semgrep twice.

### 3. Determine enabled agents

If `--background`: run only `doc-review`, `arch-review`, `naming-review`, `structure-review`. Skip all others.

Otherwise read the roster from the **Review Agents** section of `knowledge/agent-registry.md` — each row names an agent and its `agents/<name>.md` file. **Never `Read` the bare `agents/` directory** (it throws `EISDIR`); if you must confirm files on disk, list them with `Glob("agents/*.md")`, never a directory `Read` (see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/directory-enumeration.md`). All are enabled by default.

**Agent eligibility is resolved by `select_lenses.py` (#1523).** For a diff-scoped run (auto-scope or `--since <ref>`) compute the changed-file list first — the same helper step 4 reuses for the `project-structure` context payload, so this is one computation feeding two consumers, not two ways to derive the same fact (#1733, #1734). **Always** carry the same `-c diff.relative=false -c core.quotePath=false` overrides step 1's own listing uses — omitting them here would let a repo/global `diff.relative=true` (or a non-ASCII path under default `core.quotePath`) desync this list from step 1's `--files`, silently zeroing every `--added` membership match below:

```bash
set -o pipefail  # a pipeline's status is its LAST command's without this —
                  # changed_file_list.py succeeds trivially on empty stdin, so
                  # an upstream git failure would otherwise pass silently.

# Auto-scope (uncommitted changes):
CHANGED_JSON=$({ git -c diff.relative=false -c core.quotePath=false diff --name-status; \
  git -c diff.relative=false -c core.quotePath=false diff --cached --name-status; } \
  | python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/changed_file_list.py" --name-status-from -) \
  || { echo "ERROR: failed to compute the changed-file list" >&2; exit 1; }

# --since <ref>:
CHANGED_JSON=$(git -c diff.relative=false -c core.quotePath=false diff --name-status <ref>...HEAD \
  | python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/changed_file_list.py" --name-status-from -) \
  || { echo "ERROR: failed to compute the changed-file list" >&2; exit 1; }
```

`$CHANGED_JSON` holds `{"files": [{"path", "status"}, ...], "added": [...]}`. Extract both lists into their own variables **first, with an explicit failure check** — a process substitution's own exit status is invisible to the command it feeds, so if the extraction silently produced nothing this step is where that must be caught, not left for `select_lenses.py` to (indistinguishably) treat as "nothing changed":

```bash
FILES_LIST=$(printf '%s' "$CHANGED_JSON" | python3 -c 'import json, sys; print("\n".join(f["path"] for f in json.load(sys.stdin)["files"]))') \
  || { echo "ERROR: failed to extract file list from CHANGED_JSON" >&2; exit 1; }
ADDED_LIST=$(printf '%s' "$CHANGED_JSON" | python3 -c 'import json, sys; print("\n".join(json.load(sys.stdin)["added"]))') \
  || { echo "ERROR: failed to extract added-file list from CHANGED_JSON" >&2; exit 1; }
```

Now run, feeding those two variables — not a separately-interpolated `<target files>` placeholder — to `select_lenses.py` via `--files-from`/`--added-from` process substitution:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/select_lenses.py" \
  --files-from <(printf '%s\n' "$FILES_LIST") \
  --added-from <(printf '%s\n' "$ADDED_LIST")
```

Deriving both from the same quoted `$CHANGED_JSON` variable — rather than re-interpolating individual paths as shell words — is what actually closes the injection surface; `--files-from`/`--added-from` on their own only fix the two hazards specific to `select_lenses.py`'s **own** argv parsing (a path beginning with `-` reinterpreted as a flag; word-splitting on an unquoted space) and do not by themselves protect a caller that builds their input by shell-interpolating untrusted path text some other way. For `--path`/`--all`/the full-repository fallback, where there is no diff and therefore no `$CHANGED_JSON`, this skill still passes the target-file list as plain `--files <target files>` argv, matching every other file-list-consuming script call in this skill (`change_shape.py`, `change_size.py`, `closing_pass.py`) — narrowing that broader, pre-existing pattern is a separate initiative, not part of this fix.

Always pass `--added-from` for a diff-scoped run, **even when `added` is `[]`** — an empty process substitution still supplies an explicit empty set (narrows away any added-only lens), whereas omitting the flag entirely reverts to the fail-safe fallback (matches an added-only `Scope:` like a plain glob list). Omit both `--files-from` and `--added-from` only for `--path`/`--all`/the full-repository fallback.

Take its `lenses` array as the Scope-eligible roster, and **surface its `warnings`** in the review output — a bare agent name means that agent is missing its `Scope:` declaration and was included include-biased; `unnarrowed-added-only:<name>` (#1733) means an added-only lens was kept un-narrowed (matched like a plain glob list) because this run supplied no `--added`/`--added-from`; `skipped-non-executable:<name>` (#1923) means a `Scope: always` lens on the resolver's own `NON_EXECUTABLE_SKIP_ELIGIBLE` allowlist (`correctness-review` today) was dropped from `lenses` because every changed file matched a docs/config/asset/lockfile pattern that lens's own `## Skip` clause already covers — this is a deliberate cost optimization, not a coverage gap, so treat it as informational rather than `fail`-equivalent, distinct from the two shapes below; `unreadable-registry:<file>` means the roster could not be read at all; `unreadable-files-from:<path>`/`unreadable-added-from:<path>` mean the named `--files-from`/`--added-from` source could not be read — **treat either as equivalent to a `fail` status** for this run (an unreadable source is not "nothing changed") rather than proceeding as if the (now-truncated) file list were complete. Never silently drop any of these shapes from the report. The resolver reads each review agent's body-level `Scope:` declaration — `Scope: always` (eligible for any non-empty changeset), a glob list (eligible only when at least one target file matches a declared glob), `Scope: added-only` + globs (eligible only when a target file matching a declared glob was newly *added* — `component-architecture-review`'s dual-placement rule, #1733: unconditional in `/repo-review`, added-only here), `Scope: test-files` (eligible only when a changed file is a test file, resolved against `knowledge/test-file-indicators.md`'s single shared encoding rather than a glob list, which could not express `test_*.py`, `__tests__/`, or the C#/Java annotation indicators — `test-smell-review` declares this, #1978; note `test-review` deliberately stays `Scope: always`, because its coverage-gap check must see production diffs that add code *without* a matching test), or `Scope: on-demand` (never eligible for this per-diff roster at all — `token-efficiency-review`, `ai-provenance-review`, and `claude-setup-review` declare this; they are repo-wide drift/trend metrics dispatched instead by the whole-tree `/repo-review` command, #1735, and `refactor-opportunity-review` declares it too, #1976, dispatched by name at `/build`'s slice review checkpoint where its post-GREEN charter actually applies). `Scope:` is a body declaration, not frontmatter (`agent-contract.json`). This is the single source of truth shared with `/build`'s inline checkpoints: adding or changing an agent's trigger scope needs only an edit to that agent's own body — zero edits to this skill. (The framework-reactivity agents react/vue/angular are **not** in the resolver's roster; they are governed by the manifest rule below.)

**Framework-specific reactivity review** — dispatch based on the project's dependency manifest (`package.json` etc.):

- React (`react` / `react-dom` in deps): include `react-reactivity-review` scoped to `.jsx`/`.tsx` and React-importing `.js`/`.ts` files
- Vue (`vue` in deps): include `vue-reactivity-review` scoped to `.vue` and Vue-importing `.js`/`.ts` files
- Angular (`@angular/core` in deps): include `angular-reactivity-review` scoped to `*.component.ts`, `*.component.html`, `*.service.ts`, and general `.ts` files

If `review-config.json` exists at the repo root, honor its per-agent `"enabled": false` flags.

**Change-shape gate for low-yield lenses (#1254).** After the eligible roster is
known, drop the two low-yield code lenses (`performance-review`,
`correctness-review`) when the changeset has **no runtime surface** — every
target file is documentation or config, so those lenses would only no-op. Decide
deterministically with the shared helper (not by eyeballing the file list):

```bash
python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/change_shape.py" --files <target files>
```

It prints `{"hasRuntimeSurface": <bool>, "isTestOnly": <bool>, "isProseOnly":
<bool>, "skipLenses": [...]}`. When `skipLenses` is non-empty, exclude those
agents from this run and note the skip in the report (they were gated by
change shape, not by `Scope:`).

`isProseOnly` (#2104) reports a third, independent property: every changed
file is `.md`/`.mdx`. Unlike `hasRuntimeSurface`, this makes **no** exception
for functional Claude-config markdown (`agents/`, `skills/`, `knowledge/`,
`.claude/`, …) — that markdown drives agent behavior, so `performance-review`
and `correctness-review` still apply to it, but a `.md` file cannot exhibit an
injection/auth/data-exposure vulnerability, a domain-boundary leak, a
test-coverage gap, or a resource leak/N+1 query regardless of whether it also
happens to be functional config. When `isProseOnly` is true, `skipLenses`
additionally drops `security-review`, `domain-review`, `test-review`, and
`performance-review` — each of those four agents' own `## Skip` clause
already self-reports skip on a documentation-only target, so keeping them in
the roster either pays for a self-reported skip or, worse, produces an
ungrounded finding stretched to fit the lens (the motivating case: a 9-agent
panel dispatched against a single-file skill-markdown diff produced
elaborate security/domain/test/performance framing for what were really
prose nits). `correctness-review`, `spec-compliance-review`, `doc-review`,
`structure-review`, `naming-review`, and `arch-review` stay in the roster —
they meaningfully review markdown-as-instructions. This is narrower than
`select_lenses.py`'s own `NON_EXECUTABLE_SKIP_ELIGIBLE` allowlist, which
considered and rejected filtering `security-review`/`domain-review` for its
broader "non-executable" category (docs **and** config/lockfiles/assets) —
see that module's comment. This gate never widens to config, so that
rejection does not apply here.

`isTestOnly` (#1964) reports a second, independent property: every changed file
is *provably* a test file (`knowledge/test-file-indicators.md`). It currently
**gates nothing** — `change_shape.py`'s `TEST_ONLY_SKIP_LENSES` ships empty —
and exists so `/build` can stamp `diff_shape` on its `review-value.jsonl` rows
and `/harness-audit` can split per-lens outcomes by it. Populating that list is
a separate, per-lens decision that must cite the measured split, exactly as the
architectural-impact gate requires for widening `GATED_LENSES`. Read the field
for telemetry; do not narrow a roster on it until it does gate something. The gate is **fail-safe**: any
file it cannot prove is doc/config (source, an unknown extension, or functional
Claude-config markdown under `agents/`, `skills/`, `knowledge/`, `.claude/`, …)
counts as runtime surface and keeps every lens. This never fires on a pure-docs
changeset — that is already handled earlier by the documentation-only
short-circuit; this gate covers the doc/config-**mixed** and config-only diffs
the short-circuit does not. Bypassed by `--force` and by `--agent <name>` (an
explicit single-agent request always runs that agent).

**Change-size gate for small changesets (#1339).** After `Scope:` eligibility
and the change-shape gate above have both been applied, apply this gate —
never before, and never in a way that re-adds an agent either already removed.
It narrows the `Scope: always` roster by diff *size* rather than file *type*:
the pre-PR hook (`hooks/pre_pr_review.py`, #1886) requires a `.pr-review-passed`
hash match **and** (#1461, floor lowered to 1 by #2147) >= 1 distinct, recent,
registered review-agent dispatch recorded in the dispatch ledger — so this
gate must never narrow `keepAgents` below 1, and today's four-agent floor
(`security-review`, `correctness-review`, `spec-compliance-review`,
`doc-review`) clears that with room to spare. Which specific agents to keep at
a given diff size remains this step's decision, not the hook's — the hook
only enforces the *count*
floor, never which agents satisfy it.

**Applies only to diff-scoped reviews** — auto-scoped uncommitted changes, or
`--since <ref>`. `--path`, `--all`, and the full-repository fallback review
complete files, not a diff, so this gate never engages for those scopes
(existing eligibility unchanged).

Compute the numstat lines and feed them to the shared helper — for auto-scope,
union unstaged and staged the same way step 1 unions `--name-only`:

```bash
# Auto-scope (uncommitted changes):
{ git diff --numstat; git diff --cached --numstat; } | python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/change_size.py" --numstat-from -

# --since <ref>:
git diff --numstat <ref>...HEAD | python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/change_size.py" --numstat-from -
```

It prints `{"filesChanged": <int>, "addedLines": <int>, "qualifiesForFastPath":
<bool>, "keepAgents": [...]}`. When `qualifiesForFastPath` is `true`, drop
every `Scope: always` agent **not** in `keepAgents` (today: `security-review`,
`correctness-review`, `spec-compliance-review`, `doc-review` — the four lenses
that stay meaningful at any diff size; the rest are code-quality-at-scale
concerns a diff this small essentially cannot exhibit meaningfully) and note
the drop in the report (gated by change size, not by `Scope:`).
`Scope:`-glob-matched agents are unaffected — they already run only against
matching file types, so a diff this small already narrows their incremental
cost to near-zero. The gate is **fail-safe**: any `git diff --numstat` error,
binary-file marker, or unparseable line disqualifies the run (full panel), as
does any file under `hooks/` or `skills/code-review/` (the enforcement
machinery and this gate's own orchestration) — a change there is exactly the
case where a cheap, self-certifying review is a problem, so it never qualifies
for the shortcut it defines, regardless of size. Bypassed by `--force` and by
`--agent <name>`, matching the change-shape gate's bypass list.

**Diff-signal gate for structural and concurrency lenses.** Apply this
**third**, after `Scope:` eligibility, the change-shape gate, and the
change-size gate — never before, and never to re-add an agent an earlier gate
already removed. It narrows by *what the diff's content proves is absent*
rather than by file type or diff size, and it gates two lenses:
`arch-review` (structural signals) and `concurrency-review` (concurrency
primitives, #1975).

`arch-review` is `Scope: always` and opus-tier, so it runs on every non-empty
changeset — including diffs that cannot exhibit what it looks for. Its scope
is ADR compliance, layer-boundary violations, dependency direction, and
pattern consistency: all properties of *structure*. A diff that adds a guard
clause inside an existing function, with no import change, no added/moved/
deleted file, no manifest edit, and no public-interface change, has moved no
boundary for it to evaluate. Decide deterministically:

```bash
# Auto-scope (uncommitted changes):
{ git -c diff.relative=false diff --no-color; git -c diff.relative=false diff --cached --no-color; } \
  | python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/change_impact.py" --files <target files>

# --since <ref>:
git -c diff.relative=false diff --no-color <ref>...HEAD \
  | python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/change_impact.py" --files <target files>
```

It prints `{"signals": [...], "hasArchitecturalImpact": <bool>, "skipLenses":
[...], "reason": <str|null>}`. Exclude any agent in `skipLenses` and note the
skip in the report (gated by diff signal, not by `Scope:`). The seven signals
are `structure` (file added/deleted/renamed), `dependency` (an import/require
line added or removed), `manifest`, `infra`, `interface` (a public/exported
symbol declaration added or removed), `adr`, and `concurrency` (a concurrency
primitive added, removed, **or visible in a hunk's context lines** —
async/await, threads, locks, channels, atomics; removing synchronization is a
concurrency change exactly as much as adding it, and the context lines are
what keep the lens on a body-only edit inside an already-locked block, which
carries no primitive on its own changed line). `hasArchitecturalImpact` reports only the first six: a diff whose
sole signal is `concurrency` has moved no boundary, so it keeps
`concurrency-review` while `arch-review` still drops.

The gate is **fail-safe and include-biased**: an unparseable diff, an empty
diff, or any file it cannot classify all count as impact and keep every lens.
It can only remove a lens it can prove has nothing to look at. Bypassed by
`--force` and `--agent <name>`, matching the other two gates' bypass list.

**Only these two lenses are gated, deliberately.** Both pass the same test —
the lens's subject must be *provably absent* from the diff, not merely
unlikely to appear in it: `arch-review` reviews structure, and
`concurrency-review` reviews races, async ordering, idempotency, and
shared-state safety, none of which can exist where no concurrency primitive
does. `domain-review`
is the obvious next candidate and is excluded on purpose: its scope covers
"business logic placement", and putting business logic into a controller
method body is a real violation introduced by a *body-only* edit with no
structural signal — exactly the diff shape this gate skips. Widen
`GATED_LENSES` from #1624's measured per-agent data, not from intuition about
which lens probably no-ops. Same evidence-first discipline
`knowledge/verification-mode.md` applies to tier-down opt-ins.

### 4. Run each enabled agent

**Dispatch-capability gate (re-confirm here, not just at the top of this file — issue #1461).** Before spawning anything below, re-verify the `Agent`/`Task` tool is present in this toolset. If it is not, STOP per the Orchestrator constraints above — do not fall back to reviewing the files yourself, inline, as a stand-in for the panel; report the missing capability and halt the run before any agent is spawned.

**Dispatch batching — bounded dispatch waves (issue #1752).** A real run that spawned all 16 eligible agents as parallel `Agent` calls in one message lost its last 6 to `[Tool result missing due to internal error]` — see `dispatch_waves.py`'s module docstring for the full incident account; not restated here to avoid two copies drifting apart. Before spawning, compute the wave split deterministically instead of guessing a safe batch size by eye:

```bash
sh "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/py.sh" "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/dispatch_waves.py" --agents "<comma-separated eligible agent names, cheap-first order as select_lenses.py returned them, filtered by the change-shape/change-size/change-impact gates but not re-sorted>"
```

Prints `{"maxParallel": N, "waves": [[...], [...]]}` — `maxParallel` defaults to **10**, overridable with `DEV_TEAM_MAX_PARALLEL_REVIEW_AGENTS` (see the script's own docstring for the exact fallback rule; don't re-derive it here). Dispatch **exactly the waves the script printed, in that order** as parallel subagents in a single message per wave using the Agent tool — exactly as before, just bounded per message — waiting for each wave to fully return before dispatching the next, and for the last wave before aggregating. A roster no larger than `maxParallel` is always a single wave; nothing changes from today's behavior in that case.

**Optional: shared context pack (#2006, opt-in — off by default).** `scripts/review_context_pack.py` can prepare the panel's file context **once** — changed-file list, diff, and complete line-numbered file bodies — so each lens reads one prepared artifact instead of opening the same changed files itself.

**Do not use it unless the caller explicitly opts in** (`DEV_TEAM_REVIEW_CONTEXT_PACK=on`). The default dispatch path is the per-agent context payload described below, unchanged.

Why it is off by default: [ADR 0034](../../../../docs/adr/0034-do-not-build-shared-context-pre-pass-for-duplicate-full-file-reads-1611.md) declined exactly this pre-pass after measuring duplicate full-file reads at **0.38%–4.86% of a round's total input spend, median 0.8%** (#1618). A later re-measurement with the same tool (`scripts/measure_full_file_duplication.py`) put it at **0.22%**. The 4.31x figure sometimes quoted for this is a *read-volume ratio*, not a share of spend — a different denominator, and not the one this decision turns on. The pack ships full file bodies rather than the structural skeleton ADR 0034 warned would degrade line-level lenses, so it carries no known quality risk; it simply has not been shown to pay for itself. #2024 tracks measuring panels of >= 8 agents, which is the shape that could change the answer.

When opted in:

```bash
git -c core.quotePath=false diff --name-status <base> \
  | sh "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/py.sh" "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/review_context_pack.py" \
      --name-status-from - --base <base>
```

Prints a manifest naming the pack path, its byte size, and `files_omitted`. Pass the pack path to each dispatched agent, and observe both rules:

- **The pack narrows repeated reads, not the review.** A lens may still open anything not in the pack — a caller in an unchanged file, a sibling module. Never instruct an agent to treat the pack as the complete world.
- **`files_omitted` is not optional to relay.** When the manifest reports omissions (a file over the per-file cap, a binary, a body that would exhaust the budget), name those paths in each agent's prompt and tell it to open them directly. The pack body says so too, but a silently skipped file is a coverage hole that reads as a clean review.

- **File scope**: pass only files matching each agent's declared scope. Skip the agent if no files match.
- **Ledger-scoped dispatch (#2167).** Once every agent's File scope above is known, consult the per-lens verdict ledger before building any dispatch prompt — a repeat review must not pay to re-derive an outcome an exact `(lens, file, content)` match already recorded:
  ```bash
  python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/verdict_scope.py" --root . --lens-files '<JSON: {"<agent>": [<its File-scope files from the bullet above>], ...} for every agent surviving step 3''s gates>'
  ```
  Prints `{"toDispatch": {<agent>: [...]}, "skipped": {<agent>: [{"file": ..., "verdict": {...}}]}, "fullySkippedLenses": [...]}`.
  - Narrow each agent's File scope to `toDispatch[<agent>]` before building its dispatch prompt and Scope marker (below) — its ledger-cleared files are simply removed from both, never added to. An agent named in `fullySkippedLenses` gets exactly the same treatment the File-scope bullet above already describes for "no files match": do not dispatch it this round, and leave its wave slot unused — no change to how `dispatch_waves.py` is invoked above.
  - **Report loudly, never silently.** A second `/code-review` over an unchanged target set must dispatch zero lenses AND say why: the report (step 7) and `--json` output name every ledger-skipped `(lens, file)` pair together with the matched row's `ts`/`file_content_hash`/`plugin_version` (`verdict_scope.py`'s own `skipped[<agent>]` entries carry this verbatim). A run whose entire roster lands in `fullySkippedLenses` states so explicitly ("N lenses skipped via ledger evidence, 0 dispatched this run") — an empty per-agent table with no such note is indistinguishable from a broken run and must never appear.
  - **Fail closed.** `verdict_scope.py` skips a file only on an exact `(lens, file_path, current content hash)` match whose most-recent ledger row is `outcome: "pass"`. A missing/unreadable ledger, a hash it couldn't compute (deleted/unreadable/oversized file), a `findings`-outcome row, or a stale `plugin_version` row (`hooks/lib/review_verdicts.py`'s own `_is_usable_version`) all dispatch that file normally — see that script's module docstring for the exhaustive list. This step only ever narrows the File scope computed above; it never widens it.
  - **The PR gate needs no change here.** `hooks/pre_pr_review.py`'s dispatch-ledger corroboration (step 9, below) is keyed on the branch/staged-diff's own `subject_hash`, independent of this per-file ledger: an unchanged target set that fully ledger-skips also has an unchanged `subject_hash`, so the same dispatch-ledger row a prior, genuine dispatch already stamped for that hash still corroborates the gate — "reviewed, nothing to do" and "never reviewed" stay distinguishable through that pre-existing mechanism, not a new one this step would have to invent. Whenever at least one file's content actually changed, at least one real dispatch happens for it and stamps a fresh row for the new `subject_hash`, exactly as before this step existed.
  - **`overall` (step 5) is unaffected by which files were skipped here.** A fully ledger-skipped agent contributes no *new* finding (its last verdict for this exact content was already `pass`), so it can never turn `overall` to `warn`/`fail` on its own — `--json` computes the same `overall` a from-scratch full-panel run over this exact content would.
- **Scope marker (#2166)**: append one structured, single-line marker to every dispatch prompt, listing the exact files passed under File scope above (as narrowed by Ledger-scoped dispatch, immediately above), comma-separated: `Files in scope for this review: <path>, <path>, ...`. This is metadata for `hooks/review_verdict_recorder.py` (#2166 Step 2.3), the `SubagentStop` verdict recorder that parses it back out of the transcript.
- **Context payload** (controlled by the agent's `Context needs`):
  - `diff-only` → diff output only (for auto-scope or `--since` only)
  - `full-file` → complete files
  - `project-structure` → full files + directory tree + the changed-file list (path + change type — `A`/`M`/`D`/`R`/`C`) computed in step 3 via `changed_file_list.py`, for diff-scoped runs (auto-scope or `--since`). Omit the changed-file list for `--path`/`--all`/full-repository scope — there is no diff to describe. Every `project-structure` agent (`arch-review`, `doc-review`, `domain-review`) has no Bash grant and must never invoke `git` itself to "see what changed" — that call is denied and surfaces as a spurious error (#1734); this payload is what makes that unnecessary.
  - When reviewing full repository (clean auto-scope, `--all`, or `--path`), always pass full files.
- **Model**: pass each agent's declared `model:`/`effort:` frontmatter. The harness resolves both fields natively before dispatch, per `agents/orchestrator.md` → Model/Effort Resolution (ADR 0026).
- **Static analysis context**: if step 2b produced findings, inject into every agent's prompt using the format in `skills/static-analysis-integration/SKILL.md`: "These issues were detected by static analysis. Do not re-report them. Focus on semantic concerns."
- **Per-agent output**: the shared contract in [`knowledge/review-agent-output-contract.md`](../../knowledge/review-agent-output-contract.md), wrapped with `agentName`/`modelTier` (full aggregation shape in `output-format.md`).

**Graph-assisted review**: pass tool availability to **all read-only review agents** — the structural lenses (`arch-review`, `component-architecture-review`, `structure-review`, `domain-review`) benefit most from resolved call graphs, but every lens gains cheaper verified reads — so they may consult the index for impact/dependency context before flagging findings. Tool selection and the fallback contract are the same as step 1c above; see [`knowledge/codegraph-vs-graphify.md`](../../knowledge/codegraph-vs-graphify.md).

**Dispatch failure handling — retry once, never drop silently (issue #1752).** After **each wave** returns, check every agent dispatched **in that wave** (not the full eligible roster — a later wave hasn't dispatched yet) for a valid per-agent result matching [`review-agent-output-contract.md`](../../knowledge/review-agent-output-contract.md).

**Contract-valid is a per-agent classification, computed, never eyeballed (issue #1998).** Session-report analysis found 18.2% of review-agent outputs silently discarded because "does this look like the contract?" was a judgment call with no record of what it decided or why. For **each** agent that returned *something* this wave (not the ones that errored out with no return at all — those go straight to `dispatch_reconcile.py`'s missing set), write its raw final-turn text with the **Write tool** — never a shell heredoc, `echo`, or `printf`, which would interpolate agent-produced text into a command line — to a file named `.claude/memory/contract-raw-<agent>.md` (the `.md` suffix matters: only that suffix, not an arbitrary filename under `.claude/memory/`, is covered by this repo's own `.gitignore`; project-local), then classify it deterministically before deciding whether it belongs in `--returned` below. Delete the file once classification completes — including when `validate_review_output.py` itself errors out — so unredacted raw agent output never lingers on disk longer than necessary:

```bash
sh "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/py.sh" "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/validate_review_output.py" --agent "<name>" --file "<path to that agent's raw output>"
```

Exit 0 (`"valid": true`) means include this agent's name in `dispatch_reconcile.py`'s `--returned` list below and proceed to parse its JSON normally. Exit 1 means it does **not** go in `--returned` — the script has already appended a diagnostic (agent name, a secret-redacted prefix of the raw output, and the specific validation error, classified by `shape` — see [`knowledge/telemetry-schema.md`](../../knowledge/telemetry-schema.md)'s `contract-failures.jsonl` section for the closed set of shapes, not re-enumerated here to avoid the two copies drifting apart) to `.claude/metrics/contract-failures.jsonl`, so this is no longer a silent drop. A `schema-drift` or `malformed-json` failure additionally carries `extraction`, naming which extraction path (`clean`/`fenced`/`prose-preamble`) recovered the object before it failed, so that information survives even when the object arrived fenced or behind a prose preamble. Carry the printed `shape`/`extraction`/`error` forward into this agent's step 4 item 3 `dispatchFailures` entry below (as their own fields, not concatenated into `error`) instead of the generic `"output that doesn't parse against the contract"` text, so the report names the actual reason. `skills/code-review/scripts/contract_failure_report.py --json` joins that log against `agent_dispatch_ledger.py`'s dispatch counts to report a real per-agent contract-parse failure *rate* — consult it before citing any per-lens `$/finding` figure, which divides by this same denominator.

Now compute the dispatched-vs-returned coverage check deterministically over the resulting `--returned` set instead of eyeballing the two lists:

```bash
sh "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/py.sh" "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/dispatch_reconcile.py" --dispatched "<this wave's dispatched agent names, in the order dispatch_waves.py listed them>" --returned "<this wave's contract-valid agent names>"
```

Both flags are required — pass an empty string (`--returned ""`) when no agent in the wave returned a contract-valid result (the whole-wave-loss case #1752 exists for). Prints `{"missing": [...]}` — every name it returns is a **dispatch failure**: a call that came back as `[Tool result missing due to internal error]`, with no `agentId`, or with output that doesn't parse against the contract per the deterministic check above, so it never produced a contract-valid return. Distinct from `skip` (agent had nothing to review this run — [`review-agent-output-contract.md`](../../knowledge/review-agent-output-contract.md#status-values)) and from `fail` (agent ran and found errors); it means the lens never actually ran.

1. Retry each failed agent **exactly once**, individually — same prompt, model, context payload, and file scope as the original call, dispatched on its own (not re-batched with the rest of that wave).
2. Run the retry's raw output through `validate_review_output.py` the same way as the first attempt above before deciding it succeeded. If it comes back valid, use its result and continue as normal — this never shows up as a failure in the final report. A recovered dispatch — one that fails once but succeeds on its single retry — never reaches the dispatch-failure emission point in step 3 below: no `dispatch-failure` boundary event is ever emitted for it.
3. If the retry also fails contract validation, do **not** proceed as if that lens's coverage were complete:
   - Carry it into step 5's aggregation as a `dispatchFailures` entry (`{agentName, attempts: 2, error, shape, extraction}`), using the retry attempt's `validate_review_output.py` `shape`/`extraction`/`error` when the retry returned unparseable output — the same specific reason already logged to `contract-failures.jsonl` — or the transport error text (`"Tool result missing due to internal error"`, etc.) in `error` with `shape`/`extraction` both `null` when it never returned at all. The `dispatchFailures` key itself is always present in `--json` output (an empty array when there are none, per `output-format.md`); the prose report's `## Dispatch Failures` section renders only when the array is non-empty, and is never omitted in that case because "the rest of the panel passed."
   - At this same moment — the point an unrecovered failure is determined — also emit a `dispatch-failure` boundary event, bound to the `subject_hash` in effect for this dispatch (the same `branch_diff_gate_hash(default_base_ref(cwd), cwd)` value this file's doc-only/single-agent exemption calls already compute, per #1886) — so `hooks/pre_pr_review.py`'s own `_dispatch_failure_verdict` can find it at `gh pr create` time:
     ```bash
     HASH=$(python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/lib/review_gate_hash.py" --branch-diff)
     python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/lib/boundary_events.py" --event dispatch-failure --agent "<name>" --subject-hash "$HASH"
     ```
   - Treat it as fail-equivalent for step 9's gate-write condition — the same treatment step 3's `unreadable-registry`/`unreadable-files-from` handling already gets: a lens that never ran is a coverage gap, not a passing result, so `.pr-review-passed` must not be written while any dispatch failure is outstanding.
   - State plainly, in both prose and `--json` output, which agent(s) failed twice and the error text — a missing lens must always be visible, never inferred from a shorter-than-expected agent table.

### 5. Aggregate results

**Fold in dispatch failures first (issue #1752).** Before scoring or suppression, add every step 4 `dispatchFailures` entry (agents that failed dispatch, then failed their single retry) to the aggregation. They are not agent results — they carry no `issues[]` and never enter ACCEPTED-RISKS suppression or health scoring — but they are never dropped either: carry the full `dispatchFailures` list through to the report (step 7) and the `--json` object (`output-format.md`) unchanged, and remember it for step 9's gate condition.

**A non-empty `dispatchFailures` forces `overall: "fail"`, unconditionally (issue #1752).** This is not the same rule as step 9's gate-blocking condition below — it belongs here, in the aggregate itself, because step 9 (and its gate) is **skipped entirely under `--json`** (step 7), while `overall` is the one field every `--json` caller reads. `/pr --json` (the sole such caller) checks only `overall`/`status` before proceeding to open a PR; without this rule here, a lens that failed dispatch twice could sit invisibly behind an `overall: "pass"` computed only from the agents that did return, and `/pr` would open the PR anyway — the exact silent-coverage-gap failure mode #1752 exists to close, just reached through a different caller than the interactive gate. Apply this override after health scoring computes what `overall` would otherwise be, so it always wins regardless of the per-agent severity mix.

**Fold in ledger skips the same way (#2167).** Carry step 4's `verdict_scope.py` `skipped` map through to the report and the `--json` object as `ledgerSkipped` (`output-format.md`), unchanged and never dropped, even when it is every agent in the roster. Unlike `dispatchFailures`, a ledger skip does **not** force `overall` toward `fail`/`warn` — it means a lens already reached `pass` on this exact content, not that it never ran — so score `overall` from the agents that actually dispatched this round exactly as if the ledger-skipped ones were absent from the roster entirely (never absent from the *report*, only from the score). A roster that is ENTIRELY ledger-skipped therefore reports `overall: "pass"` with zero `agents[]` entries and a non-empty `ledgerSkipped` — the report and summary text must say so explicitly (see step 4's "report loudly" rule) so that state is never mistaken for an empty, broken, or unreviewed run.

#### 5a. Apply ACCEPTED-RISKS.md

If `ACCEPTED-RISKS.md` exists at the repo root, parse its `rules:` YAML frontmatter per `knowledge/accepted-risks-schema.md`. For each finding, check rules in declaration order; the first match suppresses and emits one audit entry:

```
SUPPRESSED: <file>:<line> [<rule_id>] by ACCEPTED-RISKS rule <rule.id>
```

- Expired rules become inert: stop suppressing, emit a WARN naming the rule and owner, list in an Expiry Report section.
- Rules with `broad: true` (wildcard `rule_id` or multi-file globs) emit an informational notice for auditor attention.
- Schema-invalid rules fail the run with a parse error naming the rule id.

Suppressed findings are removed from scoring, listed under "Suppressed by ACCEPTED-RISKS" in the report (grouped by rule id), and bypass the fix loop.

#### 5b. Health scoring

Read `knowledge/review-rubric.md` for the formula. Compute the overall health score; security failures auto-escalate to 🔴.

Classify each issue by actionability:

| Severity | Confidence | Actionable? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| error or warning | high or medium | **Yes** — auto-apply |
| error or warning | none | No — report only (human judgment) |
| suggestion | any | No — report only |

**Actionable issues** drive the fix loop.

#### 5b-i. Record round 1 (#1624)

The initial panel is **round 1**. Append its row to
`.claude/metrics/review-value.jsonl` now, before any fix is applied — this
stream is what makes #1623's "is this churn or value?" question answerable at
all, and a row written only on the happy path would bias every derived metric:

> **Reading this stream later.** `scripts/review_value_coverage.py` reconciles
> these rows against `agent_dispatch_ledger`'s deterministic dispatch records
> and rules on whether the sample can support a per-lens pruning decision
> (`no-data` / `unverifiable` / `undercollected` / `insufficient` / `biased` /
> `usable`). Both writers of this stream are triggered by agent instruction
> rather than by mechanism, so rows skew toward rounds that found something
> (#2019). `/harness-audit` step 4 consults it before citing any per-lens
> value; nothing in this skill needs to run it.

```bash
python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/review_round_log.py" \
  --round 1 --agents "<comma-separated agents dispatched>" \
  --findings <path-to-this-round's-findings.json> \
  --purpose discovery --outcome "<fixed|no-op|escalated>"
```

Round 1 never passes `--fix-diff`: it has no preceding fix, so its
`fix_provenance_new` is `0` by definition. The script writes counts, agent
names, and enum values only — never file paths, code, or finding text.
Full schema: `knowledge/telemetry-schema.md` § `review-value.jsonl`.

Every later round records itself the same way from step 6a — see that step's
"Record each round" item for the `--fix-diff` argument that turns
`fix_provenance_new` into the "the previous fix introduced this" signal.

#### 5c. Consolidate cross-agent findings

When multiple agents flag the same `file:line`, emit one `topFindings` entry: `severity` = the single **highest** enum for that finding, `agents` = an array of the reporting agents (e.g. `["structure-review", "correctness-review"]`). Never pack multiple values into `severity` or any agent scalar — no slash- or comma-joined strings. Every scalar field stays single-valued; multi-agent attribution lives only in the `agents: []` array. Schema: [`output-format.md`](output-format.md#aggregated-json-result---json-flag).

**Dedup across agents, not just across identical lines — prose only, never the `topFindings` array itself.** The `topFindings` JSON array keeps the existing exact `file:line` dedup key unchanged — one entry per distinct `file:line`, matching `output-format.md`'s contract and `scripts/consolidate.py`'s sliced-mode dedup key. The instruction below governs only how findings are *described in the human-facing prose summary/report*: when writing that prose, collapse any two findings — from different agents, even at slightly different lines — that describe the same underlying defect into a single description; do not restate the same defect twice in prose just because two agents (or two nearby lines) reported it.

**Condensation cap.** Condense each surviving finding to ≤ 3 lines per finding before final synthesis output — the essential defect description and fix, not each agent's full reasoning. Applies only to the human-facing summary/report; `topFindings` entries keep their full `message`/`suggestedFix` text unchanged.

### 6. Present findings and ask for direction

If zero actionable issues, skip to step 7.

Otherwise present the Review Findings prompt (template: [`output-format.md`](output-format.md#review-findings-prompt-interactive--step-6)) and ask: **"Fix these issues automatically, or save as report only?"**

- "Fix" / "apply" / "yes" → step 6a
- "Report" / "no" / "don't fix" → step 7 (no code modified)

**Exception — non-interactive mode**: skip this prompt when the run is non-interactive.

- (a) If `--json` (or `--yes`), **default to report only** — proceed to step 7 and emit the aggregated JSON; **never modify code** without an explicit caller opt-in. `--json` is contractually non-interactive (CI-safe): it never blocks on this prompt.
- (b) If running inside `/build`, `/pr`, or `/test-improve`, proceed to the fix loop. The caller owns the human gate (the orchestrator's Phase 3 approval for `/build`; the pre-PR confirmation for `/pr`; for `/test-improve`, the Phase 3 Story-set approval gating entry to Phase 4 and the `[r]evise/[w]aive/[q]uit` prompt raised after 2 failed iterations of its own end-of-phase review loop — see `../test-improve/SKILL.md`'s Phase 4/5 "End-of-phase review loop" sections).

### 6a. Review-fix loop

```
iteration = 1
MAX_ITERATIONS = 5

while actionable_issues > 0 AND iteration ≤ MAX_ITERATIONS:
    1. Apply fixes for all actionable issues (file-by-file, top-to-bottom by line)
    2. After each iteration's fixes, run the project's test suite.
       If tests fail, revert the last fix that broke them and mark the
       issue [auto-fix failed — human review required].
    3. **When the review was auto-scoped to uncommitted changes**, stage the
       fixes just applied (`git add` the modified files) — an Edit/Write only
       touches the working tree, it does not change `git diff --cached`, so
       without this the fixes would never reach the eventual commit (#1461
       security re-review: an earlier draft's step 1 claimed a working-tree
       edit "naturally" changes the staged hash — false for
       `sha256(git diff --cached)`, and it silently dropped every fix-loop
       iteration's output from the final commit). For `--path`/`--all`
       scopes, leave the index untouched — no gate is ever written for those
       scopes, so staging here would only mutate the operator's index
       unasked, for no corroboration benefit. **`--since <base>` also writes
       a gate file (issue #1904 Bug 2b — no longer "the only scope", per step
       9's own extended condition), but has no staging concept to mirror
       here at all**: its content is already-committed history
       (`base...HEAD`), so a fix applied mid-loop would need a fresh COMMIT,
       not a `git add`, to change what the eventual `--branch-diff` hash
       covers — a disclosed gap in this loop's mechanics for that scope, not
       fixed here; the closing pass below stays scoped to the auto-scope
       staging model for the same reason.
    3b. **Deterministic-first triage (#1610) — language-agnostic, not
       Python-specific.** Before re-dispatching an agent to re-verify a fix,
       check whether the fix already qualifies for a cheaper, deterministic
       close: (a) it is a pure rename/mechanical edit (docstring correction,
       import fix, identifier rename), (b) **whichever language-appropriate
       lint/type-check tool(s) step 2b's static-analysis pre-pass already
       detected and ran for this repo** — Tier 1 in
       `skills/static-analysis-integration/references/tool-configs.md`
       (semgrep + ruff/mypy for Python, pmd for Java/Kotlin, ESLint/tsc for
       JS/TS, `dotnet format`/`dotnet build` for C#, gofmt/`go vet` for Go,
       etc. — whatever the target project's own stack is, never assume
       Python) — plus the full test suite already ran clean in step 2, and
       (c) the specific claim needing verification is itself checkable by a
       targeted `grep`/diff (e.g. "every occurrence was renamed, no
       partial/mangled identifiers", "the removed import has no remaining
       references"). When all three hold, run that deterministic check now
       and mark the issue resolved on a pass — do not spend a re-dispatch
       confirming what the language's own lint/test/grep tooling already
       proved. Escalate to the normal per-agent re-dispatch (step 4) whenever
       any condition fails to hold, or the check itself can't fully close the
       question (e.g. judging whether a restored docstring's *prose* is
       accurate needs semantic reading, not a grep). This is a triage habit,
       not a gate: it only ever *removes* work from step 4, never adds new
       issues or skips a fix that genuinely needs judgment. The same triage
       applies to ad-hoc fix-verification inside `/build`'s inline review
       checkpoints (`../build/SKILL.md` sub-steps 4/6) — one shared habit,
       not a duplicated checklist.
    4. Re-run only the agents whose remaining actionable issues were not
       already closed by step 3b's deterministic triage, **in verification
       mode** (#1628) — pass the finding, the fix diff hunks ± ~20 lines,
       and the agent's lens definition, NOT the full target file set, and
       grant the mandatory `insufficient-context` escape. Resolve each
       agent's verification tier with `python3
       "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/verify_tier.py" --agent <name>`. Full
       contract: [`knowledge/verification-mode.md`](../../knowledge/verification-mode.md).
       Carry forward statuses of agents that passed.
    5. Re-aggregate. Reclassify remaining issues.
    5a. **Classify the round against the ledger (#1625).** Run the round
       ledger (below). It decides new-vs-carried by finding signature and
       returns `terminate`/`reason` — honor it: `converged` and `round-cap`
       both leave this loop.
    5b. **Record this round (#1624).** Append one row per re-dispatch round
       to `.claude/metrics/review-value.jsonl`, passing THIS iteration's fix
       diff so `fix_provenance_new` can be computed (see below).
    6. iteration += 1

if iteration > MAX_ITERATIONS AND actionable_issues > 0:
    escalate to human with remaining issues
```

**Round ledger and termination rules (#1625).** The loop above has an
iteration cap but, on its own, no notion of finding *identity* across rounds
— so nothing detects "this round found only residue from the last fix" or
"we are churning". Classify every round's findings with the shared helper:

```bash
# RUN_ID identifies this changeset; the ledger is discarded if it belongs to
# a different one. Any stable digest of the target set works.
RUN_ID=$(printf '%s\n' <target files> | sort | sha256sum | cut -c1-16)
python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/finding_signature.py" \
  --round <N> --findings <this-round's-findings.json> \
  --run-id "$RUN_ID" \
  --state .claude/memory/review-round-state.json
```

It prints `{"round", "new", "carried", "actionable_new", "ledger_reset",
"terminate", "reason"}` and maintains the durable ledger at
`.claude/memory/review-round-state.json`, so `/continue` can resume a review
mid-loop and step 6a's `--carried` count for #1624 comes from the same
source rather than being re-derived from memory.

**Ledger lifecycle — the ledger must never leak across runs.** Reusing a
ledger built for a different changeset would misclassify a genuinely new
finding as "carried" (silently skipping a round that should have run) and
inflate the round counter toward the cap on unrelated history. Four reset
triggers, in precedence order, all handled by the script:

| Trigger | When |
| --- | --- |
| `--reset` | Explicit, caller-forced |
| Round 1 | The initial panel **is** the start of a new run by definition. `/code-review` always calls round 1 first, so an abandoned ledger can never leak into the next review — no caller bookkeeping needed |
| `run-id-mismatch` | The stored ledger was built for different target files. Catches a resume that legitimately starts at round ≥ 2 against a different changeset |
| `stale-state` | The run started more than 24h ago — abandoned residue |

This ledger covers rounds *within* one `/code-review` invocation only — a
caller that re-invokes `/code-review` across separate command runs is the
place that scopes those *separate* invocations to the fix-diff instead of
restarting at round 1 every time. `/pr`'s own gate-retry loop
(`../pr/SKILL.md` step 2) is that caller today.

Reported as `ledger_reset` on every call (`null` when a stored ledger was
legitimately resumed). The script fails **toward** a reset: an unreadable or
malformed state file starts fresh. Starting fresh costs at most one extra
round; reusing a wrong ledger silently skips one. A finding's signature is
`(agent, file, category, normalized message)` with the line compared at
±3 rather than hashed — see the script's own docstring for why the line is
deliberately outside the hash.

Three termination rules, evaluated at each round boundary, **first match
wins** — the helper implements all three, this text is the contract:

| Rule | Trigger | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hard round cap** | `round >= 4` (initial panel + 3) | Escalate to human, attaching the round ledger as evidence — which rounds found what, with fix provenance. Same posture as the existing `MAX_ITERATIONS` escalation, and step 9 treats it the same way (no gate write). Applied to #1619's case study, this alone would have surfaced the churn at round 4 instead of round 9. |
| **Severity floor** (rounds ≥ 2) | No *new-signature* finding is `error`/`warning` at `high`/`medium` confidence | Converged — leave the loop. Suggestion-tier and low-confidence findings from round ≥ 2 still go to `corrections/` and the report: **logged, never chased.** Round 1 is unaffected — its actionability is step 5b's table, not this floor. |
| **Loop-until-dry** | A round produces zero new-signature findings clearing the floor | Converged. Carried signatures that survived a fix attempt are already covered by the existing "same issues persist → escalate" exit; they are not a reason to keep going here. |

The same three rules govern `/build`'s inline checkpoint fix loops
(`../build/SKILL.md` sub-steps 4/6) — one shared statement, one shared
implementation, not a duplicated table.

**Record each round (#1624).** The initial panel was round 1 (step 5b-i);
each fix-loop iteration's re-dispatch set is one further round. Capture the
iteration's fix diff **before** re-staging (item 3) so the row can attribute
this round's new findings to the previous round's fix:

```bash
# Item 1 applied fixes; capture them as a diff, then (item 3) `git add` them.
git -c diff.relative=false diff --no-color > "$FIX_DIFF"
# …after item 5's re-aggregation:
python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/review_round_log.py" \
  --round <N> --agents "<agents re-dispatched this round>" \
  --findings <this-round's-NEW-findings.json> \
  --carried <count of findings carried over from the prior round> \
  --purpose "<discovery|verification|closing>" \
  --outcome "<fixed|no-op|escalated>" \
  --fix-diff "$FIX_DIFF"
```

`fix_provenance_new` — how many of this round's new findings land inside the
line ranges the previous round's fix touched — is the judgment-free "the fix
introduced it" signal #1623 asks for. It is interval math over the diff, not
an LLM call: a round whose new error/warning findings **all** carry
provenance is churn by construction. `--purpose` distinguishes a discovery
panel from a fix-verification re-dispatch and from the gate-closing pass, so
per-agent cost can be split by purpose rather than lumped into one dispatch
count. Derived metrics (churn ratio, per-agent discovery-vs-verification
split, gate recidivism) are computed by `/harness-audit` — see its Step 4a.

**Closing pass — re-establishing dispatch-ledger corroboration after the loop (#1461, narrowed by #1626, floor lowered to 1 by #2147; auto-scope only — same condition as item 3 above).** Step 3's `git add` changes the staged content's hash, so `agent_dispatch_ledger.py` stamps each iteration's re-dispatched agents (step 4) with that NEW hash — not step 4 (the outer, pre-loop)'s original dispatch hash, and not an earlier iteration's hash either. Step 9's gate write needs **>= 1 distinct dispatch whose `subject_hash` equals the FINAL staged content's hash** (the one actually committed). Since floor 1 is normally satisfied by construction (the loop only re-stages when it applied at least one fix, and that fixer re-dispatches against the final content in the same iteration), the closing pass below degenerates to "just the fixer(s), self-verifying" in the common case — it still exists, unconditionally, for the cases that don't already clear the floor on their own: the escape hatch (scope grew mid-loop) and a `fixed_by_agents` set that ends up empty despite a loop iteration having run.

This used to be satisfied by re-dispatching the **full** original panel, which made a one-line fix cost an 18-agent round. **Unconditionally, after any loop iteration ran** (i.e. any fix was applied and re-staged) — not only when the count looks short, since that count isn't something to reason about from memory — run a **closing pass** instead. Compose it deterministically, don't pick the set by hand:

```bash
python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/closing_pass.py" \
  --fixed-by "<agents whose findings were fixed during the loop>" \
  --roster "@<select_lenses.py output>" --panel "<the round-1 panel>" \
  --panel-files "<files the round-1 panel targeted>" \
  --fix-delta-files "<files the cumulative fix touched>"
```

It prints `{"agents", "scope", "escape_hatch", "reason", "topped_up"}`. Dispatch exactly the `agents` it returns, and record them with `dispatch_purpose: "closing"` (#1624) so the cost effect is measurable.

- **Composition**: every agent whose findings were fixed during the loop (each verifies its own fixes at the final hash), plus — only if that set has fewer than 1 distinct agent — a cheap-first top-up from the resolver's eligible roster until 1 distinct registered agent has dispatched at the final hash.
- **Why this is sound**: 1 is `pre_pr_review.py`'s `_MIN_DISTINCT_DISPATCHES` (#2147; lowered from 2), so the gate's corroboration floor is satisfied **by construction** — no hook change, no exemption event, no ledger change. The threat model #1461 closed (self-certification without dispatch) is untouched: these are genuine dispatches carrying real review authority over the only content that changed since full-panel coverage. A drift test pins the script's constant to the hook's, so raising the gate's floor can never silently under-compose this pass.
- **Scope**: the closing pass reviews the **cumulative fix delta** — the diff between what the round-1 panel reviewed and the final staged content — with the round ledger's fixed findings as context. Not the whole changeset: the panel's round-1 coverage of unchanged content is still valid; only the fix delta is unreviewed.
- **Escape hatch**: when the fix delta touches files outside the original panel's target set (scope grew mid-loop), the script returns `escape_hatch: true` and `scope: "full-changeset"` — fall back to the full re-dispatch. This is a set comparison of two file lists, not a judgment call.

**This pass is a real review, not a rubber stamp**: closing-pass agents keep full authority. If any reports an actionable issue, treat it exactly like any other iteration — re-enter this loop (subject to `MAX_ITERATIONS` and #1625's round cap) rather than proceeding to step 7. What #1626 changed is only *how many* agents re-read *how much* content; never whether their findings count. If the iteration limit or the round cap is reached with issues still outstanding, follow the existing "escalate to human" exit condition below — step 9's gate-write condition explicitly excludes this case (treat it as if overall status were `fail` for that one purpose, even if every outstanding issue is only `warning`-severity), so an escalation is never silently overridden by a passing gate write. A corroboration pass whose findings carry no consequence would be exactly the "dispatch trivial calls purely to clear the gate" abuse `pre_commit_review.py`'s own module docstring names as the residual risk this mechanism does NOT protect against.

**Exit conditions**:

| Condition | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Zero actionable issues | Exit → step 7 |
| Round ledger returns `converged` (#1625) | Exit → step 7. A clean convergence, not an escalation: no new-signature finding cleared the severity floor, so step 9's gate write proceeds normally |
| Round ledger returns `round-cap` (#1625) | Exit → escalate with the round ledger attached. Treated exactly like the iteration-limit row below for step 9's gate-write condition |
| Iteration limit (5) | Exit → escalate (#1461: step 9 treats this as `fail` for its gate-write condition, even if remaining issues are only `warning`-severity) |
| Same issues persist | Exit → escalate — not converging (same #1461 step 9 treatment as the iteration-limit row: this is also an escalation with actionable issues outstanding, not a quiet exit) |
| Tests fail after fix and revert | Mark issue human-required; continue |

The round cap (4) binds before `MAX_ITERATIONS` (5) in practice: the cap
counts total dispatch rounds including the initial panel, the iteration
limit counts fix-loop passes only. Both remain — the cap is the churn
control, the iteration limit the original backstop.

**Record the escalation state for step 7, not only step 9 (issue #1880).**
Whichever exit condition above was hit — `round-cap`, iteration limit, or
"same issues persist" — is an **escalation**; `converged` (including the
zero-actionable-issues and round-ledger-`converged` rows) is not. Carry that
boolean (escalated vs. converged) forward out of this loop: step 9 already
consults it for the `.pr-review-passed` gate-write condition, and step 7 now
also consults it — under `--json`, where step 9 never runs at all — to force
`overall: "fail"` in the emitted JSON object per the parallel rule in
[`output-format.md`](output-format.md#aggregated-json-result---json-flag).
Without carrying this state to step 7, an escalated review with only
warning-severity issues remaining would emit `overall: "warn"` in `--json`
mode and a caller like `/pr`'s internal `--json` call would never see the
escalation.

Track each iteration for the report — template in [`output-format.md`](output-format.md#review-fix-loop-iteration-log-step-6a-iv).

### 7. Generate report

**Output paths.** All file artifacts (`./corrections/*.json`, `.claude/memory/.pr-review-passed`) are repo-relative to the target repository's working directory (the cwd `/code-review` was invoked in). Never prepend a scratchpad, sandbox, or session root onto an already-absolute path, and never join two absolute paths. `--json` prints to **stdout** and writes no file.

Read `knowledge/review-template.md` for the structure.

**If `--json`: the JSON object is the ONLY thing printed to stdout for this run — non-negotiable, not model discretion.** Emit the aggregated JSON object per the schema in [`output-format.md`](output-format.md#aggregated-json-result---json-flag) to **stdout**, write no report file, and **skip step 8 in this run, regardless of how many issues were found or whether any are actionable.** There is no fallback to prose, and no `corrections/` persistence, in `--json` mode — ever. (`/pr`'s `--json` call already only reads this JSON object's `overall`/`status` field, so this loses nothing a caller depends on.)

**Step 9 is NOT skipped by `--json` (issue #1904 Bug 2b) — emitting `--json` output and writing the PR-time gate file are orthogonal concerns.** `/pr`'s only path to `gh pr create` (`skills/pr/SKILL.md` step 2.4) invokes `/code-review --since "$BASE" --json` — so a review that is BOTH `--json` AND scoped via `--since <base>` is exactly the shape that must reach step 9, or `.claude/memory/.pr-review-passed` is never written on the only path that actually opens a PR, leaving `PR_GATE_BYPASS_REASON` as the only way to ever open one (the "gate that cannot fail is worse than no gate" anti-pattern this repo's own root `CLAUDE.md` names explicitly). After emitting the JSON object above, continue to step 9 unconditionally — its own scope condition already narrows correctly (a no-op for `--path`/`--all`/full-repository scope, same as before). Anything step 9 itself produces (boundary events, file writes) goes to disk or stderr, never stdout — stdout must stay pure JSON.

**When step 6a ran, consult its escalation state before computing `overall` here (issue #1880).** If step 6a exited via escalation (round-cap, iteration limit, or "same issues persist" — see that step's "Record the escalation state for step 7" note), force `overall: "fail"` in this JSON object, exactly like the `dispatchFailures` override — apply it after the totals-based computation so it always wins. This is the same rule stated in [`output-format.md`](output-format.md#aggregated-json-result---json-flag); it is restated here because step 9, where this escalation previously only mattered for the `.pr-review-passed` gate, never runs under `--json`. A clean `converged` exit (or a run that never entered the fix loop at all — zero actionable issues) does not trigger this override.

**A sentence describing the JSON is not the JSON.** A completed run whose final text reads like "Aggregated JSON emitted to stdout per `--json` contract; run stops here" — with no `{...}` object actually present anywhere in that text — is a contract violation, not compliance, even though it correctly stopped rather than proceeding further. The literal final output of the turn must be the JSON object itself, not a narration of having produced it. If the next action being considered is a summary sentence announcing that the JSON was (or is about to be) emitted, that is the signal to emit the actual object instead — there is no valid end state for a `--json` run that consists of prose alone.

Otherwise (no `--json`): emit the prose summary using the Code Review Summary template in [`output-format.md`](output-format.md#code-review-summary-report-step-7-prose-mode). For that template's per-finding listing, render this round's aggregated finding list (the same list already assembled for the `--json` branch above and for step 8 — not re-derived) with `render_tiered_findings.py` (#2170) instead of listing each finding's full message inline:

```bash
python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/scripts/render_tiered_findings.py" --findings <path-to-this-round's-finding-list.json> [--expand <finding-id>|all]
```

Pass `--expand` through exactly as the caller supplied it (omit the flag entirely when the caller did not pass one): Tier-1 lines plus the expansion hint by default; the matching Tier-2 block(s) appended after the Tier-1 report when `--expand` was given. An unknown `--expand` id: relay the script's non-zero exit and "finding-id not found" message to the user rather than silently rendering nothing or crashing. Append the iteration table.

**Scope of this wiring: the prose-mode path only.** `--json` (this step's branch above) and `./corrections/*.json` (step 8) already read and write the full finding objects independently of this rendering path — neither branch calls `render_tiered_findings.py`, and this change does not touch either of them. In particular, **`--expand` is a no-op under `--json`**: the `--json` branch above is unconditional ("the JSON object is the ONLY thing printed to stdout... non-negotiable") and must never call `render_tiered_findings.py`, so under `--json` there is nothing for `--expand` to act on. This is enforced structurally — by the `--json` branch never reaching the tiered-rendering code path described here — not by a check inside `render_tiered_findings.py` or inside the `--json` branch itself.

**Write the durable report (skip when `--internal`).** See
`knowledge/report-output-location.md` for the shared write-scope convention
this step follows. When `--internal`
was **not** passed, write the identical prose summary to
`.dev-team-reports/code-review.md` in the target repository's working
directory (creating the directory if absent), overwriting any existing
file at that path — write it even when the review found zero issues. Print
one confirmation line: `Report written: .dev-team-reports/code-review.md`,
or `Report written: .dev-team-reports/code-review.md (replaced previous
run)` when a file already existed at that path. If the write fails
(permission/read-only): report `Cannot write
.dev-team-reports/code-review.md: <error>` to chat and continue unaffected —
the write failure is non-fatal. When `--internal` **was** passed, skip this
write entirely (the fix loop and every other prose-mode behavior above are
unaffected — `--internal` only suppresses this one write). Then continue to
step 8.

**`--pdf` (additive, after the write).** When `--pdf` was passed and a report
file **was** written this run, render it to a sibling PDF per
`knowledge/report-pdf-integration.md`:

```bash
sh "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/py.sh" "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/lib/report_pdf.py" .dev-team-reports/code-review.md
```

Surface the module's `Rendering PDF via <engine>…` and result lines. When no
report file was written this run (`--json` or `--internal`), `--pdf` is a
no-op: state `--pdf: no report file was written this run, nothing to render.`
and do nothing else. Under `--json`, emit that no-op line (and any render
status) to **stderr** so stdout stays valid JSON. `--pdf` never alters the
review's own output or exit status — a missing engine or render error is
non-fatal.

### 8. Save correction prompts for remaining issues

**Skip this entire step if `--json` was set.** Step 7 already skips this step for `--json` mode; corrections are never written to disk in `--json` mode. (Step 9, unlike this step, is NOT skipped by `--json` — see that step's own condition.)

For issues NOT auto-fixed (confidence: none, auto-fix failed, or suggestions), generate one correction prompt per issue using the Correction prompt schema in [`output-format.md`](output-format.md#correction-prompt-json). Save to `./corrections/` **in the target repository's working directory** (the cwd `/code-review` was invoked in). Write all output artifacts only to these repo-relative paths — never prepend a scratchpad, sandbox, or session root, and never join two absolute paths. These can be addressed manually or via `/apply-fixes`.

### 9. Write pre-commit gate file

**This step is NOT skipped by `--json` (issue #1904 Bug 2b) — see step 7's own note.** It applies whenever the scope condition below holds, `--json` or not; step 7 only skips step **8** for `--json`.

**Dispatch failures block the gate (issue #1752).** If step 5's `dispatchFailures` list is non-empty — any agent that failed dispatch and then failed its single retry — do not write `.pr-review-passed`: `.pr-review-passed` must not be written while any dispatch failure is outstanding, regardless of the overall status computed from the agents that did return. The same rationale as step 3's `unreadable-registry` treatment: a lens that never ran is a coverage gap, not a passing result, so this condition is checked **before** the status check below, not folded into it. This prose rule now has a mechanical backstop (issue #1763, carried forward to the PR-time gate by #1886): `hooks/pre_pr_review.py`'s own `_dispatch_failure_verdict` independently vetoes the gate at `gh pr create` time when a `dispatch-failure` boundary event (emitted at Step 4, above) is on record for the current branch-diff content — so a bug or a future caller that skips this step's condition, or writes `.pr-review-passed` directly, still can't silently bypass it on this path. Two disclosed limits, neither exploitable today but both worth naming rather than silently assuming away (#1763 security review):

- The backstop is inert on [`sliced-mode.md`](sliced-mode.md)'s path: sliced mode auto-engages only on a full-repo scope with nothing staged, and never writes `.pr-review-passed` at all — it replaces this step entirely, report-only — so the backstop's inertness there holds unconditionally, regardless of what `branch_diff_gate_hash()` evaluates to for that scope.
- The backstop queries only the CURRENT branch-diff hash. A dispatch failure recorded against an earlier hash — e.g. one orphaned by a later commit landing on the same branch, or by step 6a's fix loop, before that step's own condition (above) is (mis)evaluated — is not queried here. `hooks/pre_pr_review.py` has no analogue of the retired cosmetic-delta carry-forward mechanism (deliberately dropped, per that module's own docstring) to union multiple hash bindings, so a branch-diff change since a real dispatch failure silently drops that failure's veto power until a fresh review re-emits it against the new hash.

**Scope condition, extended by issue #1904 Bug 2b.** If the review was auto-scoped to uncommitted changes **OR scoped via `--since <base>`** — and the overall status is `pass` or `warn` **and step 6a did not exit with actionable issues outstanding** — whether via the iteration limit or the "not converging" exit, both of which are escalations, per that step's Exit conditions table (regardless of whether those outstanding issues are only `warning`-severity — either escalation overrides `warn` for this condition specifically, since escalating and then writing a passing gate anyway would silently defeat the escalation) — write `.pr-review-passed` to `.claude/memory/` so `hooks/pre_pr_review.py` allows the next `gh pr create` (#1886). Use the **shared gate-hash helper**, in its `--branch-diff` mode, so the writer and the pre-PR hook compute the hash identically — it hashes the branch's diff against its base (`git diff <base>...HEAD`), not the staged patch, so a commit landed on the branch after this write invalidates the gate:

**Why `--since <base>` belongs here (closing the gap Bug 2b's premise names):** `/pr`'s only path to `gh pr create` (`skills/pr/SKILL.md` step 2.4) invokes `/code-review --since "$BASE" --json` — before this fix, this condition fired ONLY for auto-scoped uncommitted changes, so `.claude/memory/.pr-review-passed` was NEVER written on the one real path that opens a PR, making `PR_GATE_BYPASS_REASON` the only way to ever open one (the "gate that cannot fail is worse than no gate" anti-pattern named in this repo's own root `CLAUDE.md`). This also resolves the hash-timing-mismatch the auto-scope path still has (see the "Known limitation" note below): `/pr`'s step 1 requires a CLEAN working tree before invoking `--since`, so the hash computed here — AFTER those commits already landed — is computed against exactly the same content `hooks/pre_pr_review.py` recomputes at `gh pr create` time; there is no "staged while uncommitted" content this write could omit.

```bash
HASH=$(python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/lib/review_gate_hash.py" --branch-diff)
mkdir -p .claude/memory && printf '%s\n' "$HASH" > .claude/memory/.pr-review-passed
```

Single line, unlike the retired `.review-passed`'s two-line format —
`hooks/pre_pr_review.py`'s own `_stored_gate_hash()` reads only the first
line. There is no normalization-invariant second line here: the
cosmetic-delta carry-forward mechanism that line existed for (#1627) was
deliberately dropped for this gate (per `pre_pr_review.py`'s own docstring),
since it fires once, at PR-creation time, rather than at every commit — the
friction that mechanism relieved does not arise here.

**Known limitation, narrowed by issue #1904 Bug 2b (was #1886 follow-up).**
`agent_dispatch_ledger.py` stamps a dispatch's `subject_hash` with
`review_gate_hash()` (the staged `--cached` diff) whenever something IS
staged, but falls back to `branch_diff_gate_hash(default_base_ref(cwd),
cwd)` — the SAME content domain this step writes and
`hooks/pre_pr_review.py` checks — whenever nothing is staged (see that
hook's own module docstring for the fallback's rationale). For a `--since
<base>`-scoped review, nothing is EVER staged (`/pr`'s step 1 requires a
clean working tree first), so every dispatch during that review stamps the
branch-diff hash directly — the write above and every corroborating
dispatch now agree on one content domain for this mode, closing the gap for
the shape #1886 identified it in.

The residual gap that remains is narrower: on an **auto-scoped
uncommitted-changes** review with multiple separate review-and-commit
cycles on the same branch, a dispatch's staged-diff `subject_hash` and this
step's branch-diff hash are mathematically identical only in the common
single-commit-then-PR shape (a branch cut from its base, reviewed once
while staged, committed, then a PR opened immediately) — exactly as before.
On a branch with multiple such cycles, the branch-diff hash written here
will not match an EARLIER cycle's dispatch `subject_hash`, and
`hooks/pre_pr_review.py` correctly fails closed at `gh pr create` time,
requiring a fresh `/code-review` run against the branch's current diff (or
a `--since <base>`-scoped re-review, which now closes cleanly per the
paragraph above) before opening the PR.

**If `--agent <name>` was used** (a sanctioned single-agent review — it deliberately dispatches exactly 1 agent, which now clears the dispatch-ledger gate's `>= 1` distinct-dispatch floor on its own since #2147 lowered it from 2; the explicit exemption event below is consequently no longer load-bearing for this case, but is still written for an unambiguous, explicit audit trail rather than relying on the ordinary count path to imply "this was a sanctioned single-agent review" after the fact), record that as an explicit, auditable exemption event bound to this same hash **contemporaneously** with the write above — same pattern as the doc-only short-circuit's exemption event (step 1a):

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/lib/boundary_events.py" --event single-agent --subject-hash "$HASH"
```

This step only runs when the review was auto-scoped to uncommitted changes or scoped via `--since <base>` (see the gate condition above). Do not `git add` a different file set, and do not recompute `$HASH` against different content, at this point: staging or hashing something other than what this run actually reviewed would write a gate hash unrelated to the review that produced it.

If overall status is `fail`, do **not** write the gate file — `hooks/pre_pr_review.py` will keep blocking `gh pr create` until issues are resolved and the review re-run.
