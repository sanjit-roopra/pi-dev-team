# Governance & Compliance

## Overview

Requirements and procedures for audit logging, multi-layer quality assurance, and ethical operation of the agent team. Ensures all agent activity is traceable, quality is validated at multiple levels, and ethical principles are maintained.

## Constraints

- The audit changelog is append-only; never modify or delete existing entries
- Never log credentials, API keys, or PII in `.claude/metrics/` or `.claude/memory/` files
- All agent decisions must be explainable on request — no black-box outputs
- Ethical concerns are never auto-resolved; always escalate to the human

## Audit & Transparency

### What Must Be Logged

| Event | Log Location | Retention |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task start/completion | `.claude/metrics/{date}-task-log.jsonl` | 90 days |
| Configuration change | `.claude/metrics/config-changelog.jsonl` | Indefinite |
| Human approval/override | `.claude/metrics/config-changelog.jsonl` — `proposed`/`evidence_shown`/`risks_surfaced` required (schema: [human-oversight-protocol § Audit trail](../human-oversight-protocol/SKILL.md#audit-trail)) | Indefinite |
| Hallucination detection | Task log entry (`hallucination_detected` flag) | 90 days |
| Context summarization | `.claude/memory/{date}-{task-slug}.md` | 90 days (30 active + 60 archive) |

### Audit Trail Principles

- **Append-only**: Log entries are never modified or deleted
- **Timestamped**: Every entry has an ISO 8601 timestamp
- **Attributed**: Every entry identifies which agent acted and who approved
- **Complete**: No decision-making gap should exist between log entries
- **Reconstructable**: For every `approval`/`override` gate-decision entry, the
  decision, the proposal, the evidence, and the surfaced risks must all be
  recoverable from the entry alone — see [human-oversight-protocol § Audit trail](../human-oversight-protocol/SKILL.md#audit-trail)
  for the field schema. Entries predating this schema (no `proposed`/`evidence_shown`/
  `risks_surfaced`) remain valid — never migrated — and are not reconstructable
  to this standard; treat them as historical, not as a compliance gap.

### Compliance Queries

To answer "why did the system do X?", trace through:

1. Task log: which agents were involved
2. Config changelog: what configuration was active at the time
3. Memory summaries: what context the agents were working with

For a gate decision specifically ("what was this approval/override based on?"),
also check gate-record completeness: does the `approval`/`override` entry carry
`proposed`, `evidence_shown`, and `risks_surfaced`? An entry missing all three is
either a pre-schema entry (acceptable) or a write site that skipped the schema
(a gap — see human-oversight-protocol's Audit trail for the required write
sites).

## Quality Assurance

### Multi-Layer Validation

Quality is enforced at four progressive layers:

#### Layer 1: Agent Self-Validation

- Every agent applies the [Quality Gate Pipeline](../quality-gate-pipeline/SKILL.md) before delivering output
- Confidence scoring on all major claims
- Tool-based verification for factual claims (file paths, APIs, data)

#### Layer 2: QA Agent Validation

When applicable (code generation, data analysis, architecture changes):

- QA agent reviews output against acceptance criteria
- Automated test generation and execution for code
- Consistency checks against existing codebase

#### Layer 3: Human Spot-Check

- User reviews delivered output
- Feedback captured via accept/reject/amend
- Patterns in rejections feed back through [Feedback & Learning](../feedback-learning/SKILL.md)

#### Layer 4: Post-Hoc Monitoring

- Orchestrator reviews task metrics during learning loop
- Identifies trends: rising rework rate, hallucination frequency, cost outliers
- Triggers configuration amendments when patterns emerge (minimum 3 occurrences)

### Quality Gates

No task output is delivered until it passes applicable quality gates:

| Task Type | Required Gates |
| --- | --- |
| Code implementation | Self-validation + QA review (if available) |
| Architecture design | Self-validation + human approval |
| Documentation | Self-validation + terminology consistency check |
| Bug fix | Self-validation + regression test |
| Data analysis | Self-validation + statistical validation |

## Ethics & Responsibility

### Core Principles

1. **Human accountability**: Humans are ultimately responsible for all outputs. Agents assist and recommend; humans decide and own.
2. **Explainability**: Every agent decision must be explainable. No "black box" outputs. When asked why, the agent must provide rationale.
3. **Bias awareness**: Agents must flag when their output may be influenced by training biases, especially in:
   - Technology recommendations (may favor popular over appropriate)
   - Estimation (may anchor to common patterns)
   - Design decisions (may default to familiar architectures)
4. **Privacy**: Agents must not log, store, or transmit sensitive data (credentials, PII, API keys) in metrics or memory files.
5. **Proportionality**: Agent autonomy should match the risk level of the task. Higher risk = more human oversight.

### Sensitive Data Handling

| Data Type | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Credentials, API keys | Never log, never store in .claude/memory/ or .claude/metrics/ |
| PII (names, emails, etc.) | Do not include in metrics entries or summaries |
| Business-sensitive data | Minimize in summaries; use references to source files instead |
| Source code | May be included in summaries when relevant to task continuity |

### When Ethical Concerns Arise

1. Agent identifies the concern and pauses
2. Flags to Orchestrator with: what the concern is, why it matters, what the options are
3. Orchestrator escalates to human (always - ethical concerns are never auto-resolved)
4. Human decides
5. Decision is logged with full rationale

## Output

Compliance checklist results (pass/fail per item) and/or new audit log entries written to `.claude/metrics/`. Be concise — report failures and entries written; omit passing items.

## Compliance Checklist

For periodic review (monthly recommended):

- [ ] All tasks in the review period have corresponding log entries
- [ ] No gaps in the config changelog
- [ ] Gate-record completeness: `approval`/`override` entries from this period carry `proposed`/`evidence_shown`/`risks_surfaced` (pre-schema entries are exempt, not counted as gaps)
- [ ] Memory summaries exist for long-running tasks
- [ ] No sensitive data present in .claude/metrics/ or .claude/memory/ files
- [ ] Hallucination rate reviewed qualitatively (no sensor yet — see CLAUDE.md "Claims discipline")
- [ ] Rework rate trend is stable or improving
- [ ] All human overrides have been reviewed for systemic issues
