# Pull Request

Role: orchestrator. This command enforces quality gates before creating a PR.

You have been invoked with the `/pr` command.

## Orchestrator constraints

1. Run the quality gate and open the PR; do not bypass failing gates.
2. Delegate review to the review agents; do not review code yourself.
3. **Be concise.** Report gate results and the PR URL, no preamble.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

- `--skip-review`: Skip the `/code-review` step (not recommended)
- `--draft`: Create a draft PR
- `--base <branch>`: Target branch (default: `main`)
- `--no-auto-merge`: Do not enable auto-merge (the default is to enable it; see Step 5)

## Steps

### 1. Pre-flight checks

Verify:

- Current branch is not `main` or `master`
- There are commits ahead of the base branch
- Working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes) — if dirty, ask whether to commit or stash

If a plan file is present (check `plans/` for the most recently modified approved or implemented plan), run the plan completion gate:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/progress_guardian.py" --pre-pr --plan <plan-file>
```

A non-zero exit means incomplete steps remain; stop and surface the findings — do not open the PR until all steps are `[x]`.

### 2. Run quality gate

Run each check sequentially. Stop on first failure:

1. **Tests**: Detect and run the project's test suite
   - `package.json` scripts: `npm test` or `pnpm test` or `yarn test`
   - `pytest.ini` / `pyproject.toml`: `pytest`
   - `go.mod`: `go test ./...`
   - `Cargo.toml`: `cargo test`
   - `*.csproj`: `dotnet test`
   - `Makefile` with `test` target: `make test`

2. **Type check** (if applicable):
   - `tsconfig.json`: `npx tsc --noEmit`
   - `mypy.ini` / pyproject.toml with mypy: `mypy .`

3. **Lint** (if applicable):
   - `eslint` in deps: `npx eslint .`
   - `ruff` available: `ruff check .`
   - `golangci-lint` available: `golangci-lint run`

4. **Code review** (unless `--skip-review`):
   - Scope the review to this branch's diff against the base branch, not the whole repo. At PR time the working tree is clean (Step 1 requires it), so a bare `/code-review --json` would auto-scope to the **full repository** — expensive, wrongly scoped, and on a large repo it can trigger the sliced-review path. Compute the merge base:

     ```bash
     BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD "origin/<base>")   # <base> defaults to main, or the --base arg
     HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
     BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
     ```

   - **Gate-retry scoping (#2087).** `/code-review`'s own round ledger (`finding_signature.py`, see `../code-review/SKILL.md` step 6a) only scopes findings *within* a single `/code-review` invocation — every fresh top-level call restarts at round 1 with the full branch diff. Left unmanaged, a second `/pr` run after a human fixes findings from the first pays full review cost again, even though only the fix delta is unreviewed. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/pr/scripts/gate_retry_state.py` is the deterministic transition function that closes that gap by persisting phase/round state across `/pr` invocations. Drive it with this bounded loop — **never more than two `/code-review` calls in one `/pr` invocation**:

     ```bash
     # Call 1: decide this call's scope (no --last-outcome yet).
     DECISION=$(python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/pr/scripts/gate_retry_state.py" \
       --state .claude/memory/pr-gate-state.json \
       --branch "$BRANCH" --base-sha "$BASE" --head-sha "$HEAD_SHA")
     SINCE_REF=$(echo "$DECISION" | jq -r '.since_ref')
     ESCALATE=$(echo "$DECISION" | jq -r '.escalate')

     if [ "$ESCALATE" = "true" ]; then
       # Retry budget exhausted for this PR's gate — stop, do not call
       # /code-review again. Surface this and fall into the same
       # proceed-anyway-or-fix branching as a `fail` below, noting that
       # further retries need `--reset` (a fresh look), since automatic
       # narrow-scoping is exhausted.
     else
       RESULT=$(/code-review --since "$SINCE_REF" --json)
       # gate_retry_state.py only knows pass|warn|fail; a doc-only
       # short-circuit (`status: "skipped"`) converges the round exactly
       # like a pass — map it before recording.
       OVERALL=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r 'if .status == "skipped" then "pass" else .overall end')

       # Call 2: record the outcome and get the next scope.
       DECISION=$(python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/pr/scripts/gate_retry_state.py" \
         --state .claude/memory/pr-gate-state.json \
         --branch "$BRANCH" --base-sha "$BASE" --head-sha "$HEAD_SHA" \
         --last-outcome "$OVERALL")
       SINCE_REF=$(echo "$DECISION" | jq -r '.since_ref')

       # Only the fix-diff -> confirm transition returns a non-null
       # since_ref here (one mandatory full-branch pass before the gate can
       # close, issue #2087 requirement 3) — run it once, immediately, in
       # this same invocation, then record it. Do not loop: this is the
       # ONLY place a third /code-review call can happen, and it never
       # triggers a fourth.
       if [ "$SINCE_REF" != "null" ]; then
         RESULT=$(/code-review --since "$SINCE_REF" --json)
         OVERALL=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r 'if .status == "skipped" then "pass" else .overall end')
         DECISION=$(python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/pr/scripts/gate_retry_state.py" \
           --state .claude/memory/pr-gate-state.json \
           --branch "$BRANCH" --base-sha "$BASE" --head-sha "$HEAD_SHA" \
           --last-outcome "$OVERALL")
       fi
     fi
     ```

     `/code-review --since <ref> --json` itself is unchanged: `/pr` owns the human gate, so code-review still runs non-interactively (skips its own "fix or report?" prompt, applies its fix loop automatically up to 5 iterations) and returns an aggregated status — only the `--since` ref is now computed by the gate-retry decision above instead of always being `$BASE`.

   - Read `DECISION`'s final `phase` and the last `OVERALL` computed:

     | `phase` / outcome | Meaning | Action |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | `phase: "done"` | Gate closed — either a full-branch pass on round 1, or the mandatory confirm pass after a narrowed fix-diff pass | Continue to step 3 |
     | `escalate: true` | Retry budget (`PR_GATE_MAX_ROUNDS`) exhausted across `/pr` invocations for this PR | Stop; do not call `/code-review` again this invocation. Surface that the retry budget is exhausted and further retries need `--reset` for a fresh full-branch look |
     | last `OVERALL` is `fail`, not escalated | Actionable findings remain after code-review's own internal fix loop | Show the remaining findings and ask the user whether to proceed anyway or stop and fix — and tell them re-running `/pr` will scope the next check to only what changed since this attempt (the fix delta), not the whole branch, unless the base moved |
     | last `OVERALL` is `pass` / `warn`, or `status` is `skipped` (doc-only short-circuit, checked before any of the above) | Nothing further to review | Continue to step 3 |

Report results as a checklist:

```
## Quality Gate
- [x] Tests pass (42 passed, 0 failed)
- [x] Type check clean
- [x] Lint clean
- [ ] Code review: 2 warnings (see below)
```

### 3. Generate PR summary

Analyze the diff against the base branch (`git diff <base>...HEAD`) and commit history to generate:

- **Title**: Short, imperative (<70 chars)
- **Summary**: 1-3 bullet points of what changed and why
- **Test plan**: How to verify the changes
- **Decisions & assumptions**: Collect everything decided without a human in the
  loop, from the run's artifacts: the plan's `## Approval` auto-approval record and
  any auto-passed gate lines from the build output; the plan's stated stances on
  `knowledge/decision-defaults.md` axes; the spec's `## Ambiguity Log` entries
  classified `inferable`; `assumptions` entries from software-engineer step outputs;
  auto-applied review fixes with `confidence: medium`; and deferred follow-ups.
  Omit the section only when every gate had an interactive human approval.
- **Evidence bundle**: Assemble per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/evidence-bundle.md`
  from the Step 2 quality-gate results plus on-disk pipeline data — **no new
  checks, no re-execution**:
  - **Checks run**: the exact Step 2 commands (test/typecheck/lint/`/code-review
    --since <base> --json`) and their results.
  - **Scope notes**: gates skipped as not-applicable in Step 2 (e.g. no
    `tsconfig.json` → type check skipped), plus `--skip-review` if passed.
  - **Untested regions**: read `baseline-coverage.json` / `coverage-history.json`
    if present; otherwise "not measured — no coverage tool detected."
  - **Residual risks**: derived-first from `.claude/metrics/review-value.jsonl` entries
    with `outcome: "escalated"`, gate-bypass audit lines, and negative coverage
    deltas; "None identified" only when all derived sources are empty.
  - This command assembles from its own runtime's live data — it never reads a
    handoff file from a prior `/build` run, so running `/pr` standalone still
    produces a complete (possibly more-degraded) bundle.

### 4. Create the PR

**Never phrase a non-closing issue reference with a closing keyword, even
negated.** GitHub's closing-keyword parser is a dumb regex over the PR body:
`(close|closes|closed|fix|fixes|fixed|resolve|resolves|resolved)\s+#\d+`. It
fires on that pattern regardless of grammar — "does not close #123", "won't
fix #123", and "this doesn't resolve #123" all still auto-close #123 on
merge (issue #977). If an issue is only partially addressed or deferred,
write around the keyword instead: "leaves #123 open", "the remaining scope
is deferred to #124", "see #123 for the rest of this work" — never
`<closing-keyword> #123` in any form, negated or not.

Before calling `gh pr create`, lint the drafted body for accidental matches:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr_close_keyword_lint.py" --body-file <body-file>
```

This is advisory only (always exits 0). If it prints warnings, rephrase the
flagged sentence per the guidance above before creating the PR — do not
proceed with a body the linter flagged without fixing the phrasing.

```bash
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "<body>" [--draft] --base <base>
```

**Check for a repo-provided template first**: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
(the canonical GitHub location). If it exists, use it as the body's base
structure instead of this skill's own hardcoded template below:

- Fill each of the template's existing sections with the corresponding
  generated content where an obvious semantic match exists — a
  "Summary"/"What"/"Description"-shaped heading gets the summary bullets; a
  "Test(ing) Plan"/"How to test"/"Verification"-shaped heading gets the test
  plan steps; a "Checklist" heading that already lists gate-shaped items gets
  the Quality Gate results.
- Preserve every section the template defines, in its own order, even when
  nothing here auto-fills it — leave the template's own placeholder/comment
  text for the operator rather than deleting the section.
- Append this skill's own **Decisions & Assumptions** and **Evidence
  Bundle** sections at the end, under their own headings, whenever the
  template has no equivalent section for them. Never drop that content
  silently just because the repo's template didn't ask for it.
- Preserve the template's own HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) — they are
  operator-facing instructions (e.g. "PR title must be conventional"), not
  placeholders to strip.

If no such file exists, fall back to this skill's own structured template
exactly as before:

```markdown
## Summary
- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>

## Quality Gate
- [x] Tests: <N> passed
- [x] Type check: clean
- [x] Lint: clean
- [x] Code review: <status>

## Decisions & Assumptions
<!-- Everything decided without a human in the loop. An empty section means a fully human-gated run. -->
- <axis or assumption> — <stance taken> — <one-line rationale / recommended-default basis>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification step 1>
- [ ] <verification step 2>

## Evidence Bundle
<!-- Per ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/evidence-bundle.md. All four headers always appear; a section with no data states why instead of being omitted. -->
**Checks run**
- `<command>` — <result>

**Scope notes**
- <what this gate does not cover for this diff>

**Untested regions**
- <coverage % + delta, or "not measured — <reason>">

**Residual risks**
- <deferred/escalated finding, waiver, or bypass line — or "None identified">
```

### 5. Enable auto-merge (default)

Unless `--no-auto-merge` or `--draft` was given, enable auto-merge so the PR lands automatically once checks pass and any required reviews are in — rather than merging directly to trunk. This is the default integration stance in `knowledge/decision-defaults.md` (auto-merge vs. direct-to-trunk).

```bash
gh pr merge --auto --squash
```

If the repository does not have auto-merge enabled (the command errors), report that and leave the PR open for manual merge — do **not** merge directly to trunk to work around it.

### 6. Report

Display the PR URL and a summary of the quality gate results.

If any gate failed and the user chose to proceed anyway, note this in the PR body as a caveat.
