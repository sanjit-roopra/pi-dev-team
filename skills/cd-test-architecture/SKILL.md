# CD Test Architecture

Role: worker. This command assesses and reports — it does not write tests or
refactor code; it hands the migration steps to `/plan` or `/build`; Step 4b's
build-vs-document ask is this skill's one interactive branch point, and even
there it proposes a Story rather than invoking `/build` itself.

## Overview

An **advisory, application-level** skill: it assesses how an existing application is tested, classifies that against a CD-aligned test taxonomy, finds the tests that can't run in a clean CI gate, and recommends a target architecture plus a migration path. It does not write tests or refactor code.

Where `test-design-advisor` works at the unit/module level and `test-smell-review` finds smells in test files, this skill works at the **whole-application** level: test types, pipeline stages, and per-component patterns.

Grounded in these knowledge references — read the first two before assessing:

- `knowledge/cd-test-architecture.md` — the six test types, the determinism→pre-merge-gate rule, the adapter rule, double validation, pipeline stages, and MinimumCD-vs-Fowler terminology.
- `knowledge/component-test-patterns.md` — per-component patterns (UI / Services / Batch) with isolation strategy and pipeline placement.
- `knowledge/database-test-patterns.md` — load when a component is database-backed: Database Sandbox isolation, Transaction Rollback / Table Truncation Teardown, and the rule that pushes most data-logic tests onto in-memory Fakes so they stay pre-merge-gate eligible.
- `knowledge/test-doubles.md` — the Stub/Fake/Mock/Spy taxonomy; load when Step 4b's database or downstream-service branch proposes a hand-rolled Fake double, so it's named correctly (a Fake, never a "mock").
- `knowledge/virtual-service-libraries.md` — the per-stack record-and-replay virtual-service library catalog, its preferred-vs-backup framing, and its Resolution order (existing-tool detected → catalog default → operator override/decline); load when Step 4b's Downstream-service branch resolves a `Build (Fake)` row's library choice.

## Constraints

- Advisory only. Assess and recommend; do not edit production or test code. Hand the migration steps to `/plan` or `/build` — including Step 4b's build-vs-document ask: it proposes a downstream Story, it never invokes `/build` or edits code directly.
- Use MinimumCD vocabulary (unit / component / contract / integration / E2E / static analysis) consistently; when the codebase uses other names, map them explicitly.
- The pre-merge gate may contain **only deterministic** tests (static, unit, component, contract). Any test that needs a database, broker, downstream service, or environment secrets configured to run is, by definition, not a pre-merge test — flag it.
- Recommend isolation via in-memory doubles (or, for downstream-service adapters, a record-and-replay virtual-service library per `virtual-service-libraries.md`) + owned adapters, validated by the double-validation loop. Do **not** recommend standing up the whole system (docker-compose of dependencies) for the gate — that is the configured-dependency problem this architecture removes.
- **Do not assume provider cooperation.** For dependencies the team doesn't control, the defense against contract breakage is consumer-owned, scheduled verification against the provider's test environment (out-of-band) plus consumer resilience — not provider-side CDC verification. Recommend accordingly.
- **Baseline before refactor (don't lead with refactoring).** For under-tested or legacy components, first recommend the best outside-in test achievable *at existing seams without changing the code* — a characterization baseline — then the refactor that improves testability under that green baseline. Never change behavior and structure in the same step. Defer the procedure to the `legacy-code` skill and use the DDD skills (`domain-driven-design`, `domain-analysis`) to suggest the target structure for the refactor.
- Minimal tooling: prefer a record-and-replay virtual-service library (`virtual-service-libraries.md`) or in-memory doubles for the pre-merge gate, one real browser for UI, testcontainers only for off-gate adapter integration. Don't recommend a sprawl of frameworks.
- Be concise: tables and ordered steps, not prose. Cite the knowledge file instead of restating it.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments: a target application/repo path or description. Optional `--component <name>` to scope to one component, `--ci <path>` to point at the existing pipeline config, **`--external-tests <path-or-repo-or-description>`** to point at tests that live outside this repo (another repo's suite, a third-party runner, Postman/Insomnia collections, manual test scripts, recorded UI flows, spreadsheets of test cases), and `--stack <id>` to override stack detection (default: detect from manifests; resolved profile key like `dotnet`, `node`, `spring-boot`, `go`, `django`, `react`, `vue`, `ssr-htmx`). `--yes` runs unattended: Step 4b's build-vs-document prompt is skipped and every flagged component defaults to Document-only, per `human-oversight-protocol`'s non-interactive convention. If little or no in-repo testing is found and no external location is given, **ask** where the application is actually tested before concluding it is untested. If no target is given, ask for one.

## Steps

### 0. Detect stack

Resolve the project's stack so the assessment can resolve concrete tools from `knowledge/test-stack-profiles/<stack>.md`. Mirrors `skills/test-design-advisor/SKILL.md:31, 62`: when `--stack <id>` is provided, **it takes precedence** and detection is skipped. Otherwise, read manifests at the target — `package.json` (refined to react/vue via dependency, or to ssr-htmx when an htmx dep is present alongside `templates/*.html`), `*.csproj` / `*.sln`, `pom.xml` / `build.gradle*`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` — and resolve the matching profile key. Load `knowledge/test-stack-profiles/<stack>.md` (and any references it points at) so the *Target architecture* table can name concrete tools per layer. When no profile matches, proceed with stack-agnostic guidance and **name the missing profile in the report** — never block on it.

### 1. Inventory the application's components

Map the deployable/testable surfaces and assign each its pattern from `component-test-patterns.md` (User Interface; API Provider / API Consumer / Event Consumer / Event Producer / Stateful Service / CLI-Library; Scheduled Job). A real system is usually several — list each surface.

**Exhaustive surface-type discovery is the mandatory default — always on, never operator-gated (issue #1464).** Every invocation of this step actively searches for each pattern type in `component-test-patterns.md`'s table (Step 1's own list above already names all eight — not a separate list to invent here), not just the first or most obvious one found. Stopping after the first obvious surface type — e.g. finding a couple of HTTP routes and concluding the inventory is complete — is a spec violation of this step, not an acceptable shallow default: a real system frequently has surfaces in more than one pattern group at once (Services *and* Batch *and* UI, say), and each group must be actively searched for, not merely recorded when stumbled upon. **Record the search itself, not only what it found**: in the Output's `### Components & patterns` table (Step 6), include a row for every pattern type actively searched for — even one with no matching surface (state `None found` rather than omitting the row) — mirroring `/gherkin-derive` Step 2's `## Analysis Coverage` section (issue #1450), so a thin run is detectable from the report rather than merely asserted here.

**Existing-tool detection (feeds Step 4b's Downstream-service branch).** While inventorying, also check the target's dependency manifest and test files for an existing virtual-service/record-replay library (e.g. Nock, WireMock, WireMock.Net, VCR.py, go-vcr). When found, note it: per `knowledge/virtual-service-libraries.md`'s Resolution order, it becomes the default recommended tool for that component's `Build (Fake)` row in Step 4b instead of the catalog's per-stack default, with no switch suggested. This is inventory-phase data gathering, not a Step 4 recommendation.

**Graph-assisted inventory.** Prefer CodeGraph/Repowise over raw `Grep` for locating components, their deployable surfaces, and existing test suites — see [`knowledge/codegraph-vs-graphify.md`](../../knowledge/codegraph-vs-graphify.md) for tool selection and the fallback contract.

### 2. Inventory the existing tests and classify them

Find the test suites **in the repo** and classify each against the six types in `cd-test-architecture.md`. For each, record: type, what it actually exercises, whether it is deterministic, and **what it requires to run** (DB URL, broker, downstream service, secrets, sleep, real clock).

If in-repo tests are sparse or absent, the application is not necessarily untested — it may be tested out-of-repo (see Step 2b — locate and harvest out-of-repo tests). Do not conclude "no tests" without checking.

### 2b. Locate and harvest out-of-repo tests

When `--external-tests` is given (or in-repo tests are sparse and the user points you to external coverage), treat the external location as the **current specification of intended behavior** and harvest it:

- **Other-repo automated suites** — read the suites; classify them by type just like in-repo tests; note that they live outside the component's repo and pipeline.
- **Postman / Insomnia / `.http` collections** — each request + its assertions describes an API contract and a scenario. Extract: endpoint, request shape, expected response, and which success/failure scenario it covers.
- **Manual test scripts / spreadsheets / recorded UI flows** — extract each step as a behavior the team cares about (a candidate component/E2E scenario), and note it is currently human-executed and non-repeatable.

Produce a behavior inventory from these sources, mapped to the component patterns from Step 1 (inventory the application's components). This becomes the **basis for improvement** — the behaviors to re-express as deterministic, in-repo, gated tests.

### 3. Diagnose CD-fitness gaps

Flag, with evidence:

- **Out-of-repo / third-party-runner testing** — the component's tests live in another repo, a separate QA runner, Postman collections, or manual scripts rather than alongside the code. **This is an anti-pattern**, even when that external coverage is extensive: the tests cannot gate the component's own merges, are not versioned with the code they verify, are usually non-deterministic and environment-coupled, and silently drift from the code. The goal state is deterministic tests co-located with the code and run in its pipeline. Flag this explicitly and treat the external suite as the *source material* (Step 2b — locate and harvest out-of-repo tests), not the destination.
- **Manual / non-repeatable testing** — behavior verified only by humans following scripts. Non-repeatable, unsuitable for any gate; each such script is a behavior to automate.
- **Mis-typed gate tests** — "unit/component" tests that require a real dependency or are non-deterministic (real clock/RNG/network/sleep). These cannot be a pre-merge gate.
- **Configured-dependency tests** — tests that need the rest of the system stood up to run.
- **Coverage gaps** — behavior (success + failure modes per the component pattern) not covered at any deterministic layer.
- **Drift risk** — doubles with no validation loop. In particular, assume **no provider cooperation**: a contract that nobody runs against the real provider on a schedule is undefended. Flag the absence of *consumer-owned, scheduled provider-contract verification in a test environment* — relying on provider-side CDC verification is not sufficient for providers you don't control.
- **No resilience to a broken contract** — the consumer assumes the provider holds; no tests that it survives a provider break (timeout, retry/backoff, circuit breaker, drifted/malformed response). Assume the provider *will* break without versioning.
- **Inverted shape** — reliance on integration/E2E where component/contract tests would gate deterministically.

### 3b. Find testable seams and the achievable outside-in baseline

For each under-tested or untested component, identify the **testable seams** — places where behavior can be observed or substituted without editing the code (HTTP handler, CLI entrypoint, message handler, exported function, existing injection points; object seams via interfaces/polymorphism, link seams via DI/module substitution). Then state the **best outside-in test achievable right now without refactoring** — a characterization test at the outermost reachable seam that locks in current behavior. This is the immediate, zero-risk baseline, distinct from the (later) clean CD gate. See `cd-test-architecture.md` → Outside-In First, and the `legacy-code` skill.

### 4. Recommend the target architecture

Per component, using its pattern: which test types cover which layers, **what to double to run pre-merge without configuration**, the success scenarios and failure modes to cover, the double-validation loop, and the pipeline stage for each (pre-merge gate vs Stage 1/2 vs out-of-band vs post-deploy). Show the resulting pre-merge gate is deterministic and config-free. For under-tested components, separate the recommendation into **(a) the outside-in characterization baseline writable today without refactoring** and **(b) the post-baseline refactor** toward this target (use the DDD skills to suggest where boundaries/seams should land).

**E2E justification gate** — canonical in `knowledge/cd-test-architecture.md#the-e2e-justification-gate`. For each E2E recommendation, document that all four conditions hold, and record one sentence per behavior explaining why E2E was *not* chosen when the first three cover it.

**The pyramid is a cost heuristic, not a target shape** — canonical in `knowledge/cd-test-architecture.md#the-pyramid-is-a-cost-heuristic-not-a-target-shape`. Per-component / per-behavior placement is the valid output; if the suite shape is pathological, name the pathology and the behaviors that suffer from it — never propose a numeric redistribution.

### 4b. Build-vs-document decision (off-gate adapter test doubles)

When Step 4 identifies one or more components needing an off-gate adapter test double (today: a testcontainers-based real-DB test, or a downstream-service adapter test), ask the operator once per run, batched across every such component regardless of adapter kind — this is the shared prompt every adapter-kind slice appends to, not a new prompt each run; the Downstream-service branch below, including its record-and-replay-library sub-question, is one such append, already shipped, not future work. The one prompt lists every such component and asks the operator, for each one, to choose exactly one of three options — there is no separate follow-up sub-question (a `Build (Fake)` row's construction-method sub-question is carried in this same prompt and reply — see the Downstream-service branch below):

1. **Build (testcontainers)** — propose a downstream Story for a real-dependency test using testcontainers (exact Story shape per the branch subsection below).
2. **Build (Fake)** — propose a downstream Story for a hand-rolled Fake double (exact Story shape per the branch subsection below).
3. **Document-only** (default) — the recommendation lands in the report as today, with no further action.

The operator answers with one of these three choices for each listed component in a single reply — one prompt is surfaced per run, carrying a per-component three-way answer, not one verdict applied to every component in the batch.

Non-interactive runs (per `human-oversight-protocol`'s `--yes` / `DEV_TEAM_AUTO_APPROVE=1` / no-TTY convention) skip the prompt entirely — no prompt is surfaced, and every such component's recommendation lands in the report only, document-only, exactly as today.

An ambiguous or absent answer for any component in the batched three-way question — for example "maybe", "I'm not sure", a bare "yes" or "no", an unqualified "build" that does not name which of the two Build options (none of these map to one of the three labeled options), or silence/empty input — defaults to Document-only for that component, same as any other ambiguous answer: never guessed, never blocked on.

Repos with no such gap see no behavior change: no prompt is asked, and the report is unchanged.

#### Database-specific branch

For the database-IS-the-SUT band, the three-way answer directly determines the outcome per component:

- **Build (testcontainers)** — propose a Story titled `[<component>] Add testcontainers-based real-DB test`. Its description names Database Sandbox isolation and both teardown options — Transaction Rollback and Table Truncation — and cites `database-test-patterns.md`.
- **Build (Fake)** — propose a Story titled `[<component>] Add hand-rolled Fake database double`. Its description names the Fake as an in-memory repository implementing the same interface, per `test-doubles.md`'s Fake taxonomy, cites both `database-test-patterns.md` and `test-doubles.md`, and always carries this caveat verbatim: "Caveat: this hand-rolled Fake cannot verify actual SQL, mapping, or schema correctness the way a real-engine test can — a deliberate coverage trade-off, not a silent downgrade."
- **Document-only** — the recommendation lands in the report only, as today; no further action.

#### Downstream-service branch

Applies to API Consumer, Event Consumer, and Event Producer components (`component-test-patterns.md`) that Step 4 flagged for the same off-gate adapter-test-double decision as the database branch above — added to the *same* batched per-run prompt, not a second prompt: the shared prompt above already states later adapter-kind slices append here, and this is that append.

Every row offers all three options identically, with no ownership-based distinction: `Build (testcontainers)`, `Build (Fake)`, `Document-only`.

**All off-gate validation of a downstream-service test double runs out-of-band, on a schedule — never pre-merge/in-band — regardless of whether the dependency is team-controlled or third-party.** This applies uniformly to the testcontainers-based adapter-integration test, the hand-rolled Fake's companion provider-contract verification, and the library-backed double's re-record/diff companion action alike, per `component-test-patterns.md`'s and `cd-test-architecture.md`'s Integration-test placement rule: a real dependency is non-deterministic regardless of who owns it, so it never earns an in-band exception.

An ambiguous or absent answer for a downstream-service row defaults to `Document-only`, the same ambiguous-answer rule as any other ambiguous answer above — not a new rule.

**When the top-level answer for a row is `Build (Fake)`, a second, narrower sub-question resolves which construction method to use — asked in the same single batched prompt and reply as the top-level three-way choice above, never a follow-up round-trip.** The sub-question applies only to rows where the operator chose (or defaulted to) `Build (Fake)`; a `Build (testcontainers)` or `Document-only` row carries no such sub-question, and any install/decline preference volunteered for either of those rows is ignored, not an error. The answer grammar is explicit and three-valued, not binary: (a) accept the recommended virtual-service library (the existing-tool-detected or catalog default, per `virtual-service-libraries.md`'s Resolution order), (b) name a specific different library, or (c) decline (hand-rolled Fake, the backup).

**An ambiguous or absent sub-answer defaults to (a), installing the recommended library — the preferred solution — not (c) decline.** This is a distinct, narrower default rule from the top-level three-way choice's own ambiguous-answer default stated above, which remains `Document-only`, unchanged: the library is preferred and hand-rolled is backup, so the safer default when this narrower sub-question is unspecified is the preferred option, not the fallback. An operator's explicit-accept answer (e.g. "Build (Fake), accept") installs the recommended library identically to this ambiguous/absent-answer case.

For an Event Consumer/Producer row whose broker protocol has no protocol-appropriate virtual-service library (per `virtual-service-libraries.md`'s broker-tooling note), this sub-question is not presented at all — the row states plainly that no such library exists for its protocol, and defaults to the hand-rolled Fake Story below, with no tool name substituted.

Each selected option proposes a Story, following the database branch's shape:

- **Build (testcontainers)** — propose a Story titled `[<component>] Add testcontainers-based adapter integration test`. Its description exercises the real outbound client against a testcontainers-hosted, protocol-compatible instance, states the test runs out-of-band on a schedule (never pre-merge/in-band), and cites the relevant `component-test-patterns.md` pattern (API Consumer / Event Consumer / Event Producer — name whichever applies). (Maintainer note, not emitted Story content: #1435 deliberately scoped the record-and-replay library-preference sub-question below to the `Build (Fake)` row only — this bullet carries no tool-selection language, enforced by `test_sub_question_only_applies_to_build_fake_row` in `tests/skills/test_cd_test_architecture_virtual_service_libraries.py`.)
- **Build (Fake)** — propose a Story titled `[<component>] Add hand-rolled Fake downstream-service double`. Its description names a hand-rolled Fake behind a team-owned thin adapter, per `test-doubles.md`'s Fake taxonomy, and cites `component-test-patterns.md`. When the sub-answer above resolves to (c) decline, the Story always carries this caveat verbatim: "Caveat: this hand-rolled Fake cannot verify that the adapter actually satisfies the real service's wire contract — pair it with scheduled provider-contract verification against the provider's real environment, per the API Consumer / Event Consumer / Event Producer patterns." The Story always — no ownership-based exemption — additionally proposes scheduled, out-of-band provider-contract verification against the dependency's real environment as a companion action, not a fourth option. When the sub-answer above resolves to installing a library instead (default, named override, or explicit accept), the Story title instead becomes `[<component>] Add <tool-name>-backed downstream-service double` (e.g. `[<component>] Add Nock-backed downstream-service double`), naming the concrete tool chosen, and its description states the library-backed double runs in-band (pre-merge); this library-backed outcome carries its own one-line caveat in place of the hand-rolled-Fake wire-contract caveat above — no wire-contract caveat is needed for a library-backed double, because the library's own off-gate re-record/diff validation (below) is what keeps it honest, not a hand-rolled assumption about the wire contract; the same scheduled provider-contract-verification companion action described above is unchanged in count — still one, not a second, additional off-gate test artifact — only its *mechanism* changes: for a library-backed double, that action is the library's own re-record/diff capability against the real dependency (when the chosen tool has one), in place of a hand-rolled contract test. When the chosen library has no re-record/diff capability, the companion action reverts to the hand-rolled provider-contract verification described earlier in this bullet — still one artifact, not a second one.
- **Document-only** — the recommendation lands in the report only, as today; no further action.

### 5. Produce a migration path

Order the moves from current → target, lowest-risk first. The spine is **baseline before refactor**: get behavior under test at existing seams *without changing code*, then refactor under that green baseline (never behavior + structure in one step). When tests are out-of-repo (Step 2b — locate and harvest out-of-repo tests), the harvested behaviors feed that baseline. Typical full sequence:

1. **Characterization baseline (no refactoring)** — at the outermost reachable seam, write outside-in tests that lock in current behavior; harvest any out-of-repo/manual behaviors into this inventory and reproduce them here. Get green.
2. **Introduce owned adapters and seams — under the baseline** (Adapter Rule; `testability-patterns.md`; DDD skills suggest where boundaries/seams belong). Refactor only with the baseline green.
3. Add in-memory doubles + deterministic **component tests** reproducing the baselined behaviors.
4. Add **contract tests** pinning request/response boundaries.
5. Add **consumer resilience tests** (survive a provider break).
6. Add **scheduled provider-contract verification** against a test environment.
7. Move real-dependency tests **off the gate** to adapter-integration / out-of-band.
8. Add **post-deploy checks**.
9. **Decommission** the out-of-repo/manual suites and the coarse characterization tests as their behaviors land in the deterministic gate.

Each step is behavior-preserving and independently shippable.

### 6. Report

Write the assessment (see Output). Keep every recommendation tied to a concrete next action.

**Report the surface-coverage gate (issue #1464).** Step 1's "Exhaustive
surface-type discovery is the mandatory default" mandate is backed by the
same coverage-gate script `/gherkin-derive` uses for its own `## Analysis
Coverage` section (issue #1450), run here against this skill's own
`### Components & patterns` section in its cd-test-architecture
configuration:

```
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gherkin_analysis_coverage_gate.py" --file <report-path> --config cd-test-architecture
```

Print the gate's result as its own report section: `OK: all 8
component-pattern categories recorded` when it exits 0, or `N
component-pattern categor(y/ies) missing from the coverage record`, listing
each missing category, when it exits 1. **A third outcome exists — exit 2
means the gate did not run** (no `### Components & patterns` section was
found in the report, or the report file itself is missing); report this as
"gate did not run — no Components & patterns section found in `<path>`,
re-check the assessment report," never as an `OK`/all-clear (a scan that
never found the section is not the same as a section with nothing
missing).

## Output

Write to `.dev-team-reports/cd-test-architecture-<app>.md` (or chat for a single component).

When `--pdf` was passed and a report **file** was written, render it to a
sibling PDF per `knowledge/report-pdf-integration.md`:

```bash
sh "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/py.sh" "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/lib/report_pdf.py" .dev-team-reports/cd-test-architecture-<app>.md
```

In the single-component **chat-only** case no file was written, so `--pdf` is a
no-op: state `--pdf: no report file was written this run, nothing to render.`
and do nothing else. Additive; non-fatal if no engine is available.

`--pdf` renders the main assessment report only; the setup guide (below) is
not rendered to PDF.

### Components & patterns
| Component | Pattern | Surfaces |

Include a row for every pattern type actively searched for in Step 1 (issue
#1464) — even when no surface of that type was found (`None found` rather
than an omitted row) — so the report shows search coverage, not just found
surfaces.

### Current tests (in-repo)
| Suite | MinimumCD type | Deterministic? | Requires to run | Pre-merge-safe? |

### Out-of-repo / external test sources (if any)
| Source (repo / Postman / manual / …) | Location | Behaviors it covers | Why it's an anti-pattern here |

### CD-fitness gaps
| Gap | Type | Evidence (file) | Impact |

### Testable seams & achievable baseline (under-tested components)
| Component | Outermost seam | Best outside-in test writable today (no refactor) |

### Target architecture (per component)
| Component | Layer | Test type | Double (to run config-free) | Pipeline stage | Build/Document status |

`Build/Document status` is one of `Build (testcontainers)`, `Build (Fake)`, or `Document-only` (set per Step 4b) for a row Step 4 flagged as needing an off-gate adapter test double. A row Step 4 did not flag for that decision (e.g. a component/layer already pre-merge-gate-eligible with no real dependency to double) carries **no value in this column at all** — left blank, never one of the three enum values and never guessed. This blank-vs-set distinction is the literal, table-level signal for which rows are off-gate-eligible; `/apply-test-doubles` cites this sentence rather than re-deriving its own eligibility rule. A row whose status is `Build (Fake)` also carries that row's branch-specific caveat, verbatim, in the same cell — see the Database-specific branch or Downstream-service branch above for the exact wording.

When Step 0 loaded a `knowledge/test-stack-profiles/<stack>.md` profile, **cite that profile** (and any reference it points at) in the *Test type* or *Double* column so the concrete tool choice is traceable to the stack-specific reference.

When a Downstream-service `Build (Fake)` row resolves to a virtual-service library (default, named override, or explicit accept), cite the chosen tool (e.g. Nock, WireMock.Net) in this same `Double (to run config-free)` column — no new column or enum value is added for it.

### Companion: test-double setup guide

Whenever Step 4's Target architecture table recommends a testcontainers-based
test, a virtual-service-library-backed double, or a hand-rolled fallback for
any component, write a companion **test-double setup guide** — independent of
that component's Step 4b Build/Document-only outcome: this applies even when
the operator chose Document-only for that component, or the run was
non-interactive, and the setup guide still includes that component's section
exactly as it would if the operator had chosen to build it.

**Path.** Write the guide to
`.dev-team-reports/cd-test-architecture-<app>-test-double-setup.md` — the
main report's own filename (`cd-test-architecture-<app>.md`) with its `.md`
extension replaced by `-test-double-setup.md`, same directory and naming
convention as the main report, never a legacy path outside
`.dev-team-reports/`. In the single-component chat-only case (the
main report goes to chat, not a file), the setup guide's content is appended
to that same chat output instead of written as a second file. When no
component in the run falls into this off-gate adapter-double decision space,
write no setup-guide file or chat section at all — never an empty one.

**Header and Provenance.** For the header block and closing Provenance
section, follow `knowledge/report-template.md`; the per-component sections
below are this guide's own body. `**Scope**` reads the components covered by
this guide — the components with a per-component section below, not the
full application inventory from Step 1.

**Per-component sections.** One section per component — even when two
components resolve to the same tool, each still gets its own section with
its own component-specific example prompt. A non-off-gate component (no
adapter-double recommendation at all) gets no section. Each section has:

1. **Tool name + one-line purpose.**
2. **Doc link** to the tool's official documentation — omitted only for the
   hand-rolled-fallback case (there is nothing to link to for hand-rolled
   code); the other three elements still apply to that case.
3. **Configuration steps** that cite — never restate — the same
   `test-stack-profiles/<stack>.md` entry (and, for the virtual-service-
   library case, the `virtual-service-libraries.md` entry) Step 4 already
   resolved for that component's `Double` column. When Step 0 resolved no
   stack profile for the component, state that plainly (e.g. "No matching
   stack profile for this component") rather than citing a profile that was
   never resolved.
4. **One concrete, ready-to-run example prompt** naming the actual component
   and tool — never a generic template placeholder.
5. The closing command `/apply-test-doubles <path>`, where `<path>` is
   always the **main assessment report's own resolved path**
   (`.dev-team-reports/cd-test-architecture-<app>.md`), never the setup
   guide's own path — per `../apply-test-doubles/SKILL.md`'s own Parse
   Arguments section, not restated here. In the
   single-component chat-only case, there is no saved main-report file to
   substitute for `<path>` — the assessment output is in this chat session,
   not a saved file — so the closing command is emitted with no path
   argument (plain `/apply-test-doubles`), never falling back to the setup
   guide's own path.

**Classification** — cited from Step 4b's branches above, not invented here:

- **Testcontainers** (Database-specific or Downstream-service branch, `Build
  (testcontainers)`) — name the testcontainers tool.
- **Virtual-service library** (Downstream-service branch, `Build (Fake)`
  resolving to a library) — name whichever tool Step 4b's Downstream-service
  branch's construction-method sub-question resolved for this component
  (see that branch above — not restated here). Caveat: this case's
  configuration steps must also cite `virtual-service-libraries.md`'s
  "Recorded artifacts contain real traffic — scrub before commit" section
  (in addition to the per-tool catalog entry) and name that tool's
  credential-filtering hook as a step ordered before the first recording,
  never after.
- **Hand-rolled fallback** (`Build (Fake)` resolving to hand-rolled, or Step
  4b's Downstream-service branch's no-matching-library fallback applying to
  this component's adapter kind — see that branch above, not restated here)
  — no doc link; the other three elements (name+purpose, configuration
  steps, and the example prompt) still describe the specific
  fake/contract-test to write for that component.

**Downstream-service components with no posed sub-question.** For a
Downstream-service component whose construction-method sub-question was
never posed or answered (the operator chose Document-only, the run was
non-interactive, or the top-level answer was ambiguous), classify it using
the same tool-resolution rule Step 4b's sub-question applies when it does
fire — see the Downstream-service branch above for what determines the
tool, not restated here — applied to rows that never got a sub-question in
the first place, because this guide's trigger is independent of the
Build/Document-only outcome, never a guess and never omitted. It falls back
to the Hand-rolled fallback classification above only when Step 4b's own
no-matching-library condition applies for this component's adapter kind —
again, see that branch, not restated here. This three-case list is
illustrative of "no sub-question ever reached this row"; it excludes the
separate case where a `Build (Fake)` row's sub-question WAS posed but got an
ambiguous or absent answer, which Step 4b's own stated default for that case
already resolves (see that branch above), not this fallback. A
volunteered-but-ignored install/decline preference on a Document-only row is
likewise not honored by this fallback either — per Step 4b's own "ignored,
not an error" framing, it defers to Step 4b's own resolution rule above (not
restated here), never the operator's stated-but-disregarded preference.

## Integration

- Pairs with `test-design-advisor` (unit/module design) and the `test-smell-review` / `test-review` agents (per-file findings). This skill sets the application-level target those operate within.
- For under-tested/legacy components, the characterization-baseline-then-refactor procedure is the **`legacy-code`** skill (Feathers' algorithm: change points → test points/seams → break dependencies → characterization tests → refactor under green). Defer the mechanics to it.
- Use the **`domain-driven-design`** and **`domain-analysis`** skills to suggest the target structure for the post-baseline refactor — where bounded contexts, ports, and seams should land — so refactoring improves the domain model, not just testability.
- Hand the migration path to `/plan` or `/build` for TDD implementation. This skill stops at the architecture and plan, except that Step 4b may propose a downstream Story as part of that hand-off — it still never invokes `/build` itself.
