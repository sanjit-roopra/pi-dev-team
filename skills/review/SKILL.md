# Review (alias)

Role: orchestrator.

## Orchestrator constraints

1. Pure alias — change no behavior.
2. Pass all arguments through to /code-review unchanged.
3. **Be concise.** Defer all output to code-review.md.

This is an alias for `/code-review`. Read and follow
`skills/code-review/SKILL.md` with all arguments passed through.

> **Keep frontmatter in sync.** This alias delegates the entire `/code-review`
> flow, so its `allowed-tools` and `argument-hint` MUST mirror
> `skills/code-review/SKILL.md`. `allowed-tools` is an allowlist — omitting a tool
> the canonical command needs (e.g. `Edit` for the fix loop, `AskUserQuestion`
> for the fix/report prompt, `Bash(ruff *)` for Python lint) silently breaks
> that capability under `/review`.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

### 1. Pass through
