Iterate the approved Phase-5 Story set. For **each Story**:

**Never dispatch multiple Stories' build loops in parallel against one shared
working tree (issue #1571).** Each Story's step 1 runs `/build`, which
`git add`/`git commit`s as it goes — two or more concurrent dispatches
against the same checkout race on the index and working files, and that race
is real: it has produced observed data loss (reverted test files, deleted
`.feature` files) even when the assigned files looked disjoint, because git
index/commit operations aren't file-scoped the way file edits are. Process
Stories one at a time in this session, or — if you fan out multiple Stories
concurrently via the `Agent` tool — dispatch every one of them with
`isolation: "worktree"` so each gets its own git working tree; disjoint file
assignment alone is not a substitute for worktree isolation here.

1. **Build** — invoke `/build <story-id>`. `/build` inherits the **no-refactor**
   mode from Phase 0: production-code changes are **rejected**. A Story that
   would require a production-code change is surfaced as a REFACTOR_REQUIRED
   deferral candidate and re-classified for Phase 6.
2. **Apply the Phase-0 binding mode.** If Phase 0 selected
   `xunit-with-annotations`, the resulting test names mirror the source
   scenario name and Given/When/Then lines appear as **leading comments**
   citing the source `.feature` file. In `bdd-runner` mode, the step
   definitions are filled in against the parser wired at Phase 3. In `none`
   mode, the test is authored idiomatically for the stack without
   feature-file citations.
3. **Coverage delta** — after `/build` closes the Story, invoke
   `/coverage-delta --workflow test-improve --story <id>`. The delta is
   appended to `.dev-team-reports/test-improve/<slug>/data/coverage-history.json`.
4. **Coverage-delta steering check (issue #1790).** After the delta is
   appended — **every Story, not only at the end of the phase** — run the
   trailing-streak check. Do not eyeball the history:

   ```
   sh "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/py.sh" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/coverage_delta_steering.py" \
     --history .dev-team-reports/test-improve/<slug>/data/coverage-history.json \
     --json
   ```

   - **Exit 0** — continue to the mutation-kill step, but read *which* exit-0
     status came back: `ok` means the last Story actually moved line coverage;
     `insufficient_history` means too few Stories have closed (or the latest
     Story's movement could not be measured) to judge a streak;
     `flat_streak_forming` means the latest Story did **not** move coverage but
     the streak is still short of the threshold — echo that one to the operator
     as a watch signal rather than silently treating it as `ok`.
   - **Exit 3** (`flat_streak`) — three or more consecutive Stories (the
     default; `--consecutive` and `--min-line-delta` tune it) moved line
     coverage by less than the minimum expected per-Story delta.
     **Surface it now, mid-phase** — a run once spent its entire Phase-5
     budget on an already-covered layer because this signal was only read at
     the end; **never defer it to the Phase-9 report.** Print the script's
     flat-Story list and running average, name the top `seam: absent` modules
     from `coverage-gap-ranking.json`, and prompt **`[t] re-check Phase-1
     targeting / [c] continue`** (shape `[t/c]` — `t` is unused elsewhere in
     this flow, and `c` keeps the "accept and move on" meaning it already has
     in mutation-kill's `[c/r/w/q]`):
     - **`[t]`** — re-read `coverage-gap-ranking.json` and re-order the
       remaining Story set into its rank order (Phase 4's rule, applied to
       what is left) before the next Story's `/build`. A remaining Story whose
       target module reads `seam: absent` under `refactor-mode: no-refactor` is
       re-classified **REFACTOR_REQUIRED for Phase 6 rather than retried** —
       retrying it under no-refactor is what produced the flat streak.
     - **`[c]`** — continue, recording `coverage_flat_streak: <n> stories` in
       `.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/phase-5.md` so Phase 8 and the
       report read it from a durable record instead of re-deriving it.
     - **Non-interactive runs** record the streak and continue — the same
       **record-and-continue posture, never a silent pass**.
   - **Exit 2** — the history file is missing or unreadable. Resolve it (the
     Story's `/coverage-delta` did not append) rather than treating the
     unknown as `ok`.
5. **Mutation-kill, once per module batch (`kill-loop` and
   `baseline+kill-loop`; skipped when `off`).** The `mutation-kill` agent is
   opus-tier at `effort: high`, and every dispatch re-pays its fixed priming
   plus the mutation tool's build/instrumentation warm-up. Phase 4 writes the
   Story set in `coverage-gap-ranking.json` rank order (#1786), so Stories
   targeting the same module are **adjacent** — dispatching per Story paid
   that fixed cost again for a scope that was warm one Story ago (#1963).

   **Group contiguous Stories by target module, then dispatch per batch.**
   Take the grouping from the ranking's own `modules` buckets — the artifact
   Phase 2 already computed — never by re-deriving a module map here. A batch
   is a maximal run of consecutive Stories in the approved order whose target
   files fall in one bucket; a module with a single Story is a batch of one,
   which behaves **exactly** as the per-Story dispatch did.

   Steps 1-4 above still run **per Story**, unchanged — the build, the binding
   mode, the coverage delta, and the steering check are per-Story signals and
   batching them would blunt exactly the mid-phase steering #1790 added. Only
   this step batches.

   After the batch's **last** Story closes, invoke the **`mutation-kill`
   agent** once with `--file <every story file in the batch> --max-rounds 3
   --target-honest-score <the Phase-0 mutation target>`.
   Residual survivors trigger the **`[c]ontinue / [r]etry / [w]aive /
   [q]uit`** prompt — the shape is `[c/r/w/q]` — applied to the batch.
   `[c]` accepts the residual and moves on; `[r]` re-runs one more
   mutation-kill round; `[w]` waives the residual to `waivers.json`; `[q]`
   quits Phase 5.

   **Pass the Phase-0 mutation target (#2030).** Phase 8
   (`/quality-targets-converge`) gates on that number; without
   `--target-honest-score` the loop runs toward survivor exhaustion instead
   and buys full-price rounds whose work cannot change the gate's verdict.
   Threading it is risk-neutral by construction — the honest score stays the
   only gate, Phase 8 still measures it independently against
   `baseline-mutation.json`, and stopping *at* the threshold cannot turn a
   pass into a fail. Omit the flag when Phase 0 recorded no mutation target;
   the loop then behaves exactly as it did before #2030.

   **A `YIELD FLOOR` line is an operator decision, not a convergence stop.**
   When the run is invoked with `--min-kills-per-round` and a round kills
   fewer survivors than the floor while the file is *still below target*,
   `mutation-kill` stops that file and logs a line prefixed
   `YIELD FLOOR —`. That is **not** a terminal stop: route it to the same
   `[c/r/w/q]` prompt above, carrying the line's kill count and floor into
   the prompt so the operator can price one more round. Treating it as
   convergence would stop a below-target file on the loop's own initiative,
   which is precisely what #2030 declined to do.

   **The gate is unchanged in coverage, only in timing.** Every Story's files
   are still mutation-processed before Phase 5 can close, at the same rounds
   cap, behind the same prompt: **Phase 5 may not be reported closed with an
   unprocessed batch**, exactly as it could not close with an unprocessed
   Story. What moves is *when within the phase* a weak assertion surfaces —
   at the batch boundary rather than immediately — which is bounded by batch
   size and by the fact that `mutation-kill` only ever *adds* tests, so a
   later Story in a batch cannot be invalidated by an earlier one's residual.

   **Name the batches when the phase starts**, so the operator sees the
   grouping rather than inferring it from dispatch counts: print one line per
   batch — `Mutation-kill batch <n>: module <module>, Stories <ids>.`

   **Mutation-yield steering check at the batch boundary (issue #2033).**
   After each batch's `mutation-kill` dispatch returns, append one record to
   `.dev-team-reports/test-improve/<slug>/data/mutation-history.json` — the
   git-tracked `data/` sibling of `coverage-history.json`, written atomically
   the way the baselines are — carrying `batch`, `module`, `captured_at`,
   `starting_survivors`, `ending_survivors`, `honest_score_before`,
   `honest_score_after`, and `rounds_spent`. Then run the trailing-streak
   check. Do not eyeball the history:

   ```
   sh "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/py.sh" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/mutation_yield_steering.py" \
     --history .dev-team-reports/test-improve/<slug>/data/mutation-history.json \
     --json
   ```

   This is the #1790 mechanism ported to the more expensive lane, and it
   shares that script's status vocabulary and exit-code contract exactly, so
   read the exit codes the same way:

   - **Exit 0** — continue to the next batch, but read *which* exit-0 status
     came back: `ok` means the last batch actually killed survivors;
     `insufficient_history` means too few batches have closed (or the latest
     batch's yield could not be measured) to judge a streak;
     `flat_streak_forming` means the latest batch did **not** clear the
     minimum but the streak is still short of the threshold — echo that one
     to the operator as a watch signal rather than silently treating it as
     `ok`.
   - **Exit 2** — the history is missing, unreadable, or corrupt. **Never
     read this as `ok`** — it is the same trap #1790 calls out. Fix the
     history before continuing.
   - **Exit 3** (`flat_streak`) — two or more consecutive batches (the
     default; `--consecutive` and `--min-kills` tune it) killed fewer than
     the minimum net survivors. **Surface it now, at the batch boundary** —
     per-Story would be meaningless because `mutation-kill` runs per batch.
     Print the script's flat-batch list and running average, then prompt
     **`[t] re-check Phase-1 targeting / [c] continue`** — the same `[t/c]`
     shape the coverage check uses:
     - **`[t]`** — re-read `coverage-gap-ranking.json` and re-order the
       remaining batches into its rank order before the next dispatch.
     - **`[c]`** — continue, recording
       `mutation_flat_streak: <n> batches` in the phase's progress file so
       the Phase-9 report carries the accepted signal rather than losing it.
6. **Go mutation-kill is advisory.** On Go stacks, `mutation-kill` logs
   survivors but makes **no commit** — the operator is instructed to apply
   changes manually. Advisory-only handling matches the Phase-0 Go advisory,
   and applies per batch exactly as it applied per Story.

#### Pending-stub gate (`bdd-runner` mode only, issue #1391)

After **all Phase-5 Stories have closed**, and only when Phase 0 selected
`bdd-runner` binding mode, run the completion gate before Phase 5 may be
reported closed — a hard gate, not prose:

```
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gherkin_stub_gate.py" --dir <step-definitions-dir>
```

(`<step-definitions-dir>` is wherever test-improve's own Phase 3 —
`/gherkin-derive`'s Step 4 (stub generation) / Step 5 (output paths) — wrote
step-definition files, recorded in `.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/gherkin.md`.)

- **Exit 0 (no pending stubs)** — Phase 5 proceeds to the end-of-phase review
  loop below.
- **Non-zero (pending stubs remain)** — Phase 5 is **not done**. Surface the
  gate's listed `file:line` pending step definitions to the operator; do not
  report the phase closed. Route each remaining stub back into the per-Story
  build loop (step 2 above — fill in the step definition against the parser
  wired at Phase 3) rather than silently leaving it pending.
- Skip entirely when binding mode is `none` or `xunit-with-annotations` (no
  step definitions exist to gate on).

#### End-of-phase review loop

After **all Phase-5 Stories have closed**, run the review loop over the
Phase-5 diff, writing evidence to
`.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/phase-5-review.json`:

<!-- include: references/review-loop.md -->
See `review-loop.md` for the single-panel dispatch, the test-lens
guarantee, the narrowed fix-confirmation, the escalation cap, and the
fixed evidence-schema fields.

**`/handoff` suggestion** (context-heavy review). Once the loop above closes, print: `Phase 5 complete. Consider running /handoff to compress context before continuing. To resume: /test-improve <repo-path> --from-phase 6 (or --from-phase with no number to auto-detect the resume point)`
