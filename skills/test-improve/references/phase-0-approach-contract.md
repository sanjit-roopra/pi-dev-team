Resolve every ambiguous input in **one batch** before any work starts, then
persist the resolved inputs to `.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/phase-0.md`. The
file must exist **before Phase 1** runs.

**Detect language(s) and stack profile.** Inspect manifests for JS/TS
(`package.json`), Java (`pom.xml` / `build.gradle`), C# (`*.csproj`), and Go
(`go.mod`). If `--stack` was passed, honor it. Record the resolved stack in
`phase-0.md`.

**Go advisory (shown before the mutation prompt when Go is detected).**

> Mutation testing on Go uses **go-mutesting**, which is **alpha**-quality.
> Survivor count is **not a gate** on Go — treat it as advisory. For real
> confidence in Go tests, prefer `go test -fuzz` on the parts of the code
> that reward it. In `baseline+kill-loop` mode the orchestrator records
> baseline and delta numbers; in `kill-loop` it records only the final
> surviving-mutant count. Either way the Phase-8 mutation target is
> advisory-only for Go.

**Prompt battery (one batch, six knobs).** Each prompt displays its default in
`[brackets]`; pressing **Enter accepts every default in one keystroke** — with
**one deliberate exception**: knob 6 (code-lookup install) is **not** part of the
Enter-accepts-all gesture, because accepting it mutates the filesystem (and, for
Graphify, the repo's `CLAUDE.md`). Knob 6 is the **sole** exception; it requires an
explicit `y`/`n` and a blank response **re-prompts** rather than defaulting either
way. This is called out in the knob-6 prompt itself so the divergence is never a
silent surprise.

1. **Mutation mode** — `[kill-loop]`. A three-way choice; the value recorded in
   `phase-0.md` and shown in the banner is the canonical token (`off` /
   `kill-loop` / `baseline+kill-loop`), used verbatim in both places:
   - `off` — no mutation testing (lightweight ceremony).
   - `kill-loop` (**default**) — run the mutant-kill loop and produce a final
     report of surviving mutants, **without** a separate baseline run first.
   - `baseline+kill-loop` — run the mutation baseline first, then the mutant-kill
     loop (a before/after mutation delta).

   **Default change — mutation now runs by default.** The old knob defaulted to
   `off` (no mutation work on Enter-through); under `kill-loop` an Enter-through
   run **now performs the mutant-kill loop**. The prompt flags this so it is
   never a silent surprise.

   **Show the relative cost with the choice (#1965).** This knob is the
   largest single cost multiplier in the workflow, and an operator pressing
   Enter through the battery was accepting it without the price ever being
   named. State it in the prompt — qualitatively, never as a fabricated dollar
   figure (`/cost-report` is the instrument for actuals):

   > Relative cost: `off` adds none. `kill-loop` adds roughly one
   > opus-tier `mutation-kill` dispatch per module batch in Phase 5 (up to 3
   > rounds each), plus the mutation tool's own runtime.
   > `baseline+kill-loop` adds a full mutation baseline run on top of that.

   This is disclosure, not a recommendation and not a default change: the
   risk-mitigation trade each mode buys is the operator's call, and mutation
   work is how assertion quality gets measured at all. Naming the price just
   makes it an informed one.
2. **BDD rubric** — five yes/no questions from
   `knowledge/references/bdd-value-guide.md`. **Default `none`** if the
   operator declines to answer. Scoring: ≥3 yes → `bdd-runner` recommended;
   1–2 yes → `xunit-with-annotations` recommended; 0 yes → `none`.

   **Relative cost (#1965)**, stated with the choice for the same reason as
   knob 1:

   > `none` skips Phase 3 entirely. `xunit-with-annotations` adds scenario
   > derivation and `.feature` authoring. `bdd-runner` adds those plus parser
   > wiring, step-definition stub generation, and the Phase-5 pending-stub
   > gate every stub must clear before the phase can close.
3. **Refactor mode** — `[no-refactor]`. Default is **`no-refactor`**. Choose
   `refactor-allowed` to permit production-code changes in Phase 7 (seams
   only; existing tests may not be modified or removed).
4. **Quality targets** — defaults: coverage ≥ 90% line + branch; surviving
   mutants = 0 (only when mutation mode is not `off`); determinism = 100%; wall-clock =
   fastest achievable. Any target can be overridden here; overrides land in
   `phase-0.md` and flow into Phase 8.
5. **Sink** — `--parent <url>` selects a tracker (ADO / GitHub / GitLab /
   Jira via the host CLI); missing CLI or omitted flag falls back to
   **local-files** mode (writes under `.dev-team-reports/test-improve/` and
   `.claude/plans/test-improve/`).
6. **Code-lookup tools (all-or-none install)** — offer to install the three
   code-lookup tools (**CodeGraph**, **Repowise**, **Graphify**) so the review
   and analysis agents read verified skeletons and resolved call graphs instead
   of re-reading whole files. **Recommended: yes** when any of the three is
   missing. This knob is an **explicit `y`/`n`** (see the Enter-accepts-all
   exception above); a blank answer re-prompts. The prompt names the three tools
   and discloses that Graphify writes a `## graphify` section into this repo's
   `CLAUDE.md` and installs git hooks.
   - **Idempotent / missing-subset.** Detect which of the three are already
     present; offer only the **missing** subset. When all three are present,
     do not prompt — record `code_lookup_tools: already present`.
   - **Delegate the install — never reimplement it.** On `y`, delegate to
     `/project-init`'s Step 4c graph-tools group (the canonical installer); do
     not duplicate install commands or probes here.
   - **Decline is visibly confirmed.** On `n`, install nothing and print
     `Code-lookup tools: skipped — agents fall back to Read/Grep/Glob.`
   - **Partial failure is recorded, not masked.** If the delegated install
     partially fails, record per-tool success/failure in `phase-0.md` and do
     not claim full install success.

**Coverage-target vs refactor-mode conflict check (issue #1787).** A stated
coverage percentage (**knob 4**) and `refactor-mode: no-refactor` (**knob 3**)
can be structurally incompatible, and Pass 1 held both at once without ever
saying so: mutation-kill work cannot raise line or branch coverage on code that
has no tests at all, and a layer at near-zero coverage generally needs a
production-code seam before any test can reach it. Resolve this **before** any
work starts — **never by waiving a gate later**, which is what happened when
branch-90 was quietly waived at a later gate while coverage-90 stayed a stated
goal to the end.

Run the check; do not judge it in prose:

```
sh "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/py.sh" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/coverage_gap_ranking.py" \
  --report <existing coverage report> --repo-root <repo-path> \
  --target-line-pct <line target> --target-branch-pct <branch target> --json
```

- **A coverage report is discoverable** — a prior run's
  `.dev-team-reports/test-improve/<slug>/data/baseline-coverage.json`'s
  `raw_report`, or a report artifact already on disk (`lcov.info`,
  `coverage.json`, `cobertura.xml`, `jacoco.csv`, `coverage-summary.json`).
  The script's `verdict` decides:
  - **`unreachable_without_seams` (exit 3)** — the target cannot be reached even
    if every module that already has a test seam went to 100%. Present the
    explicit three-way choice **`[w] waive the target / [s] switch to
    refactor-allowed / [c] continue as-is`** (shape `[w/s/c]`), naming the
    script's own numbers — `lines_needed`, `reachable_uncovered_lines`, and the
    top seam-blocked modules — so the operator sees the arithmetic, not an
    opinion. `[w]` records the target as **waived at Phase 0** with this reason
    (Phase 8 then reports it waived up front instead of discovering it); `[s]`
    records `refactor-mode: refactor-allowed` (Phase 0 is still resolving its
    own answers here, so this is not an immutability exception); `[c]` proceeds
    with `coverage_target_conflict: acknowledged` recorded. A **non-interactive**
    run **does not silently pick a stance** — it records
    `coverage_target_conflict: unresolved`, prints the same three options, and
    the conflict is restated at Phase 8 rather than resolved by default.
  - **`reachable` / `already_met` (exit 0)** — record
    `coverage_target_conflict: none` and continue.
- **No coverage report is discoverable** — do **not** fabricate a verdict from
  no data. Record `coverage_target_conflict: deferred` and run this identical
  check at Phase 2 against the freshly captured baseline, **before** Phase 1
  consumes the ranking (see the coverage-gap ranking step in
  `phase-2-baseline.md`). Deferred means
  *checked one phase later against real numbers* — never dropped, and never
  first surfaced in the Phase-9 report.

This check is skipped entirely when knob 4 left no coverage percentage target
active, or when knob 3 selected `refactor-allowed` (there is no mode conflict
to surface).

**Persistence.** Write the resolved inputs to `.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/phase-0.md` before Phase 1 runs — Phase 1 must not start until `phase-0.md` exists. This includes the knob-6 outcome (the operator's install choice, and for each tool whether it was already present, installed, declined, or failed).

**Immutability.** Phase-0 answers are **immutable** for the remainder of the
run. `--from-phase` does not re-prompt Phase-0 inputs. To change them, delete
`.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/phase-0.md` and re-run from Phase 0.

**`--analyze-only` semantics.** With `--analyze-only`, Phase 0 completes as
normal, Phase 1 (`/test-health`) runs, and the orchestrator **exits after Phase 1**
with a summary of the improvement plan. This is a deliberate carve-out:
Phase 1 runs **directly**, bypassing the default Baseline (Phase 2) / Derive
Gherkin (Phase 3) ordering (`0 → 2 → 3 → 1 → 4 → ...`) — not a contradiction
of it. No baseline is captured; no code changes.

**`--from-phase` semantics.** `--from-phase <n>` resumes **at** phase `n` and
skips every phase that precedes `n` in the **execution** sequence
`0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9` (not identity order — e.g. `--from-phase 1`
skips Phases 0, 2, and 3, not just 0). Phase-0 inputs are read from
`phase-0.md` (never re-prompted). **An explicit `<n>` is not validated
against this sequence** beyond requiring `phase-0.md` to exist — e.g.
`--from-phase 1` does not check that Phase 2 (Baseline) has actually run
first, so an operator passing an out-of-sequence `<n>` by hand can skip a
phase whose output later phases depend on (Baseline before any test-file
change, in particular). Prefer `--from-phase` with no number
(auto-detect, below) unless there's a specific reason to name a phase
explicitly.

**`--from-phase` with no number — auto-detect the resume point.** When
`--from-phase` is passed **without** a number, resolve the resume phase by
calling the helper — do **not** infer it in prose:

```
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/test_improve_resume.py" <repo-path>
```

The helper resolves the slug from `<repo-path>` (its last path segment), scans
**only** that slug's `.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/` directory for the
completed-phase progress files (`phase-0.md` … `phase-9.md`, excluding
`phase-3.md` — Phase 3 is conditional and tracked via `gherkin.md` instead,
never a numbered progress file), finds the highest completed phase in
**execution** order (`0, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9` — Phase 3 excluded, matching
the progress-file scan above), and prints a JSON object whose
`resolved_phase` is the phase to resume at and whose `message` reads e.g.
`Resuming at Phase 8 (latest completed: phase-6.md).`. Print that `message`
so the operator can confirm before work starts, then resume at
`resolved_phase`. Resolution rules the helper encodes:

- A completed `phase-5.md` with **no** `phase-6.md` resumes at **Phase 6**;
  a completed `phase-6.md` resumes at **Phase 8** (matching the `[b]`/`[q]`
  skip-to-8 flow); a completed `phase-7.md` resumes at **Phase 8**.
- Only `phase-0.md` present resumes at **Phase 2** (Baseline — the phase that
  now executes immediately after Phase 0).
- A completed `phase-2.md` with **no** `phase-1.md` resumes at **Phase 1**
  (Phase 3 has no tracked progress file, so the auto-detect skips over it —
  see `test_improve_resume.py`'s module docstring). A completed `phase-1.md`
  resumes at **Phase 4**.
- **No memory dir / no phase files / `phase-0.md` missing** — the helper exits
  non-zero; surface its error message (which points to running
  `/test-improve <repo-path>` from Phase 0) and do **not** silently start at
  Phase 0.
- A completed `phase-9.md` means the run is already complete (`complete:
  true`) — report it; there is nothing to resume.

To resolve an **explicit** `<n>` (including validating that `phase-0.md`
exists) the skill may pass `--explicit <n>`; an explicit `<n>` **overrides**
auto-detection. Auto-detect and explicit alike read Phase-0 inputs from
`phase-0.md` and never re-prompt them.

**Phase-6 prompt letter.** The full Phase-6 refactor-decision prompt —
shown only in `refactor-allowed` mode — uses `[y/b/q]` (not `[r]`; see
`phase-6-refactor-decision.md` for why `r` was avoided). `[y]` advances to
Phase 7; `[b]` backlogs the REFACTOR_REQUIRED items and
skips to Phase 8; `[q]` quits before Phase 8. In `no-refactor` mode (the
default) Phase 6 is **informational only** — no `[y]` is offered, the
REFACTOR_REQUIRED items are auto-backlogged, and the run continues to Phase 8
(see `phase-6-refactor-decision.md` for the full branch mechanics
and `phase-7-refactor.md` for the hard-mode-gate backstop that
enforces this same `no-refactor` restriction if Phase 7 is somehow reached).
