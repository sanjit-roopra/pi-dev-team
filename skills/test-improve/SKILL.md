name: test-improve
description: >-
  Consolidated analyze-then-improve test orchestrator. Defaults to lightweight
  ceremony; opts into heavier capabilities (Gherkin extraction, mutation
  testing, refactor-for-testability) only when the operator asks. Always
  baselines coverage (and mutation, when enabled) before any test change, runs
  the end-of-phase review loop after Phases 5 and 7, and produces a stable
  10-section executive-summary report. Use when the user says "improve our
  tests", "modernize the test suite", "upgrade our tests", or runs
  /test-improve.

# Test Improve

Role: orchestrator. This command sequences existing skills and agents through a
ten-phase (0-9) analyze-then-improve workflow; it does **not** implement, audit, or
write tests itself. Each phase is **delegated** to the worker skill or agent
that owns it, and per-phase progress is persisted to
`.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/phase-<n>.md` so `/continue` (and `--from-phase`)
can resume.

You have been invoked with the `/test-improve` command.

## Orchestrator constraints

1. **Delegate every phase.** Call the owning skill or agent (`/test-health`,
   `/gherkin-derive`, `/issues-from-assessment`, `/build`, `/coverage-baseline`,
   `/coverage-delta`, `/mutation-testing`, `mutation-kill` agent,
   `/quality-targets-converge`, `/test-design`, `/code-review`, `/apply-fixes`).
   Never re-implement their logic here.
2. **Honor the human gates.** Do not advance past a gate without explicit
   approval.
3. **Confirm the approach first.** Phase 0 owns the approach contract; do not
   start work until it has completed and its answers are persisted.
4. **Baseline before changing anything.** Coverage (and mutation, when
   enabled) must land directly in `.dev-team-reports/test-improve/<slug>/data/`
   before any file under the stack's test directory is modified.
5. **Be concise.** Report each phase's outcome and the next gate, nothing
   more.

## Parse Arguments

- Positional: `<repo-path>` (default: cwd).
- `--parent <url>` — optional tracker parent issue URL; the host selects the
  CLI (ADO / GitHub / GitLab / Jira). Omit for **local-files mode** (the
  default), which writes to `.dev-team-reports/test-improve/` and `.claude/plans/test-improve/`.
- `--analyze-only` — run Phase 0 then Phase 1 directly and **exit after Phase 1** with a
  summary of the improvement plan (bypassing the default Baseline/Derive-Gherkin
  ordering — see Phase 0's `--analyze-only` semantics). No baseline is
  captured; no code changes.
- `--from-phase [<n>]` — skips completed phases and resumes at phase `n` when
  `.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/phase-<n-1>.md` exists. **The number is
  optional.** Passed with **no argument**, `/test-improve` **auto-detects** the
  resume point from `.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/` (see
  `references/phase-0-approach-contract.md`): it resumes at the phase after the highest completed
  progress file and prints which phase it resolved to and why. An explicit
  `<n>` **overrides** auto-detection. Either form does **not** re-prompt
  Phase-0 inputs; to change them, delete
  `.claude/memory/test-improve/<slug>/phase-0.md` and re-run from Phase 0.
- `--stack <id>` — force a stack profile (e.g. `js`, `dotnet`, `java`, `go`)
  when manifest detection is ambiguous.

## Phase-start banner

At the start of every phase, print a two-line banner:

```
Step <position>/<total> — Phase <N>: <phase name>
mutation: <off|kill-loop|baseline+kill-loop> · binding: <none|xunit-with-annotations|bdd-runner> · refactor: <no-refactor|refactor-allowed> · sink: <tracker|local>
```

`<N>` is the phase's stable identity number — unchanged by execution order
(Phase 1 is always Analyze, Phase 2 is always Baseline, etc.). `<position>`
is a **running count of phases printed so far this run, including this
one** — increment it by exactly 1 at each phase-start banner, never
computed from a fixed per-identity table. A bare `Phase N/9` counter would
print non-monotonically under this reordered execution sequence (`2/9` then
`3/9` then `1/9`), reading as a hung or looping run to an operator watching
stdout; a plain running count fixes this without renumbering any phase,
file, or `--from-phase` flag value, and — unlike a fixed per-identity
table — it stays correct regardless of which phases actually execute.

**`<total>` is not always 9 or 10 — compute it, never hardcode it.** Two
independent things vary the count: whether Phase 3 runs (known from Phase
0's BDD binding mode: skipped when `none`, so **-1**) and whether Phase 7
runs (Phase 6's decision — Phase 7 and Phase 8 are **not alternatives**;
when Phase 6 returns `[y]`, both Phase 7 *and* Phase 8 execute in sequence,
so entering Phase 7 is **+1**, not a shared slot). Concretely:

- Base count is **9** (Phases 0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 — Phase 7 excluded
  by default).
- **-1** when the Phase-0 BDD binding mode is `none` (Phase 3 never runs) —
  known from Phase 0 onward, so this adjustment is baked into every
  banner's `<total>` from the very first one.
- **+1** the moment Phase 6 resolves to `[y]` (entering Phase 7) — this is
  **not** knowable before Phase 6 fires (an operator in `refactor-allowed`
  mode can still pick `[b]`/`[q]` and skip Phase 7 despite the mode
  permitting it), so `<total>` for Phases 0 through 6's banners uses the
  **without-Phase-7** count; if Phase 6 then returns `[y]`, print one line
  before Phase 7's banner — `Phase 7 entered — total phase count for this
  run is now <new total> (was <old total>).` — and use the new total for
  Phase 7, 8, and 9's banners. When `refactor-mode: no-refactor` (Phase 6
  offers no `[y]` at all) or Phase 6 returns `[b]`/`[q]`, no adjustment ever
  fires and `<total>` stays fixed for the whole run.

This keeps `<position>` strictly monotonic in every run shape, and
`<total>` honest at each point it's printed — correcting exactly once, with
a visible reason, only in the one case (entering Phase 7) that's genuinely
unknowable in advance.

The recap line reflects the still-active Phase-0 settings so an operator
resuming via `--from-phase` (or returning to a long-running session) sees the
current phase and active settings without scrollback archaeology.

## Steps

**Execution order.** Phases below are numbered by stable identity, not by
execution order — Phase 2 (Baseline) and Phase 3 (Derive Gherkin) execute
before Phase 1 (Analyze) so `/test-health` can use documented-but-untested
Gherkin scenarios as a coverage signal. **Document order below matches
execution order**: `0 → 2 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9`, where Phase 7
runs only when Phase 6 returns `[y]` (see "Phase-start banner" above for how
this affects the banner's `<total>`) — Phase 7 and Phase 8 always run in
that sequence together, never as alternatives to each other. When the
Phase-0 BDD binding mode is `none`, Phase 3 is skipped and the executed
sequence becomes `0 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 6 → (7) → 8 → 9`.

## Phase Reference Files

Each phase's procedural detail lives in its own reference file, listed below.

| Phase | Name | Reference file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Approach contract | `references/phase-0-approach-contract.md` |
| 1 | Analyze via /test-health | `references/phase-1-analyze.md` |
| 2 | Baseline | `references/phase-2-baseline.md` |
| 3 | Derive Gherkin | `references/phase-3-derive-gherkin.md` |
| 4 | Plan fixes | `references/phase-4-plan-fixes.md` |
| 5 | Improve without refactoring | `references/phase-5-improve.md` |
| 6 | Refactor decision | `references/phase-6-refactor-decision.md` |
| 7 | Refactor-for-testability | `references/phase-7-refactor.md` |
| 8 | Validate | `references/phase-8-validate.md` |
| 9 | Executive-summary report | `references/phase-9-report.md` |

The After-Phase-9 close-out prompt is not one of the ten numbered phases and deliberately has no row above; it is the separate `### After Phase 9` section further down, backed by `references/phase-9-close-out-prompt.md`.

Before executing a phase, read only that phase's reference file — never a
phase-specific reference file for a phase already completed in this run or a
prior resumed session. Shared implementation-detail reference files (e.g.
`references/review-loop.md`) are not phase-specific and may be read whenever
the phase you are executing points at them, regardless of whether another
phase also uses them.

This instruction is prose, not a hook-enforced gate — no mechanism in this
repo verifies at runtime that only the active phase's reference file was
read; compliance depends on the executing agent following the rule as
written.
