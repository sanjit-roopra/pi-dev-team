"""Language-neutral internal-double detector with waiver support (#2127).

Implements the unconditional rule in `knowledge/internal-collaborator-doubling.md`
(#2124): a collaborator declared in the project's own first-party source
stays real; a double is admissible only when the collaborator matches one
of three named blockers (B1 out-of-process handle, B2 ambient state, B3
prohibitive real cost), marked with an inline `double-waiver: B<n> — <reason>`
comment at the double site.

**No test-type gate.** The rule is unconditional, so this detector reads no
test-type declaration (solitary/sociable/unit/component/anything else) —
that is what closes the undeclared-file and relabel bypasses the epic's
architecture notes describe. A file is scanned the same way regardless of
what it calls itself.

**Language-neutral by construction.** One first-party declaration index plus
per-stack *data* tables (`_EXTRACTION_TABLES`, `_AMBIENT_API_MARKERS`) feed a
single shared pipeline (`extract_by_table`, `analyze`). There is no
per-language branching logic — a new stack is a new data-table row, not a
new code path. If this module exceeds ~500 lines, split the extraction
tables into a submodule rather than growing this file indefinitely (mirrors
`repo_invariants.py`'s own "start narrow, expand opportunistically"
convention) — not yet warranted at this size.

**What this detector verifies, and what it does not:**

- Resolution is **name-based, not fully-qualified-path-based**. Building a
  real cross-file import graph per language is out of scope for a
  stdlib-only script with no per-language parser. A name match against the
  first-party declaration index is treated as resolved. Two same-named
  types in different first-party modules are indistinguishable; a name
  collision with an unrelated third-party type of the same name could
  false-positive. Precision-first per the epic means under-report, not zero
  false positives.
- **Waiver syntax, not waiver truth**, for B1 and B3. A waiver naming B1 or
  B3 is `informational` once its code is syntactically valid — this
  detector cannot decide whether the claimed out-of-process handle or
  prohibitive cost is real (the epic's own architecture notes: B1 is "not
  decidable", B3 "not statically detectable at all"). `test-smell-review`
  owns that judgment.
- **B2 gets one mechanical evidence check**, not full verification: the
  epic states B2 (unlike B1/B3) is "detectable against a per-stack table of
  ambient APIs." A B2 waiver is downgraded from `informational` to `high`
  when the doubled collaborator's own declaring file shows no reference to
  any per-stack ambient-API marker (clock, RNG/GUID, env, hostname, cwd,
  locale) — a presence-of-reference check, not a behavioral proof.
  `test-smell-review` still owns the final call even when this check
  passes.
- Gate-wiring into a blocking hook or CI check is a separate issue (#2128).
  This script is a standalone CLI, proven via direct invocation and its own
  test suite.

    deliberate, disclosed policy (see `main()`'s `--changed-since`) and NOT
    the hook's (see `hooks/internal_double_gate.py`, which always fails open
    to no-block on a non-None reason instead).

    Disclosed scope note: `analyze(root)` reads the WORKING TREE, while
    `changed_files_since()`'s file list comes from the COMMITTED diff
    (`ref...HEAD`). A finding is kept whenever its FILE is in the committed
    diff, even if the doubling line itself only exists in an uncommitted
