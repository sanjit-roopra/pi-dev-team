  Validate Gherkin feature files for structural quality, determinism, and
  implementation independence, then verify each scenario has matching test
  automation. Use this skill whenever reviewing test files, feature files, or
  BDD scenarios — including during /code-review when .feature files or step
  definition files appear in the changeset. Also use when a user asks to
  "check my feature files", "validate my Gherkin", "are my scenarios
  testable", or "do my feature files have tests".

# Feature File Validation

Feature files are the contract between intent and implementation. This skill validates two things: (1) are scenarios well-formed, deterministic, and behavioral? (2) does every scenario have matching test automation?

## When to Run

- During `/code-review` when `.feature` or step definition files are in the changeset
- When `test-review` encounters feature files
- When a user explicitly asks to validate feature files or BDD scenarios
- Before `/build` as a pre-flight check

## Step 1: Find Feature Files

Locate all `.feature` files in scope. If reviewing changed files only, limit to `.feature` files in the changeset plus any referenced by changed step definitions. If none found, report skip and stop.

## Step 2: Validate Feature File Structure

For each feature file, check every category below. Read `references/validation-rules.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

| Category | What to flag | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Gherkin syntax** | Missing Given/When/Then, bad Background, empty Examples, orphan steps, blank feature name | warning |
| **Determinism** | Time-dependent steps, order-dependent scenarios, environment-dependent steps, probabilistic assertions, uncontrolled concurrency | error |
| **Implementation coupling** | Technology names, code-level details, CSS selectors, performance constraints, data structure specifics in step text | warning |
| **Scenario quality** | Multiple When steps, vague assertions ("it works"), missing negative/edge cases | warning/suggestion |

## Step 3: Verify Test Automation Coverage

For each scenario, check whether test automation exists using two strategies. A match from either is sufficient. Read `references/validation-rules.md` for framework detection patterns and naming conventions.

- **Strategy A — Step definition matching**: Find step definition files (per framework conventions) whose patterns match the scenario's step text. Covered when all steps have definitions.
- **Strategy B — Test file naming**: Find test files named after the feature file (e.g., `login.feature` -> `login.test.ts`) that reference the scenario name.

**Graph-assisted lookup.** Prefer CodeGraph/Repowise over raw `Grep`/`Glob` for locating step definition files and matching test files under either strategy — see [`knowledge/codegraph-vs-graphify.md`](../../knowledge/codegraph-vs-graphify.md) for tool selection and the fallback contract.

Report per feature file: total scenarios, covered, uncovered, partially covered.

## Step 4: Output

```json
{
  "status": "pass|warn|fail",
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "error|warning|suggestion",
      "confidence": "high|medium|none",
      "file": "features/login.feature",
      "line": 12,
      "message": "Description of the issue",
      "category": "determinism|implementation-coupling|structure|coverage",

    "covered": 0,
    "uncovered": 0,

}

Severity and confidence mappings are in `references/validation-rules.md`.
