description: Produce a written design document in docs/specs/ with user approval before planning begins. Use this skill during the Research phase when a feature request, architectural change, or non-trivial task enters the pipeline. Ensures misunderstandings are caught before any planning or implementation work starts. Also use when the user says "brainstorm", "design", "spec", or "let's think through this".

# Design Document

Role: orchestrator. This command produces a design document and gates
progression to Phase 2 (Plan) — it does not write implementation code,
scaffold a project, or take any implementation action.

## Overview

The Research phase explores what exists. This skill adds a structured output: a design document that captures the proposed approach and gets human approval before the Plan phase begins. Misunderstandings caught at design time cost minutes; misunderstandings caught at implementation time cost hours.

## Constraints
- Do not begin Phase 2 (Plan) without an approved design doc for non-trivial features
- Do not treat the design doc as a plan — it captures intent and approach, not file-level changes
- Do not skip alternatives analysis — a design doc with one option isn't a design doc, it's a plan
- The human must explicitly approve the design doc before proceeding
- **Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action** until the design doc is approved. The design doc is a gate, not a suggestion.

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "This is too simple to need a design doc" | Simple projects harbor unexamined assumptions. The design doc will be short — just write it. |
| "I already know the approach" | Then it'll take 5 minutes to write down. And the human might disagree. |
| "Writing a spec slows us down" | Misunderstandings caught at design time cost minutes. Misunderstandings caught at implementation time cost hours. |
| "The requirements are clear enough" | Clear to you. The human may interpret them differently. Write it down and verify. |

## When to Produce a Design Doc

| Task Type | Design Doc Required? |
|-----------|---------------------|
| New feature | Yes |
| Architectural change | Yes |
| Cross-cutting refactor | Yes |
| API design or redesign | Yes |
| Bug fix | No (unless the fix requires design decisions) |
| Typo/config/doc fix | No |
| Single-file change | No (unless it changes behavior significantly) |

## Document Structure

Save to `docs/specs/{feature-name}.md`:

```markdown
# {Feature Name} — Design Document

## Problem Statement
What problem are we solving? Who experiences it? What happens if we don't solve it?

## Proposed Approach
High-level description of the solution. How does it work? What are the key components?

## Alternatives Considered
| Approach | Pros | Cons | Why rejected |
|----------|------|------|-------------|

At least two alternatives. "Do nothing" counts as one.

## Key Decisions
Decisions that constrain the Plan phase. For each:
- What was decided
- Why
- What trade-off was accepted

## Open Questions
Things that need answers before or during planning. Tag each with who should answer (human, architect, domain expert).

## Scope Boundaries
What's explicitly in scope and out of scope. This prevents scope creep during planning and implementation.

## Visual Artifacts (optional)
Diagrams, mockups, data flow sketches — anything that clarifies the design. Use Mermaid for diagrams when possible.
```

## Process

1. **Research**: Explore the codebase, understand the problem space
2. **Draft**: Write the design doc based on research findings
3. **Present**: Show the design doc to the human at the Research phase gate
4. **Approve/Revise**: Human approves, requests changes, or redirects
5. **Proceed**: Approved design doc feeds into Phase 2 (Plan) as input alongside the research progress file

## Integration with Phases
- **Phase 1 output**: Research progress file + approved design doc
- **Phase 2 input**: Design doc provides intent and constraints; Plan phase specifies exact file changes
- **Agent-Assisted Specification**: Design doc complements BDD scenarios — design doc captures the "why" and "how", scenarios capture the "what"

## Output
A design document at `docs/specs/{feature-name}.md` reviewed and approved by the human before the Plan phase begins.
