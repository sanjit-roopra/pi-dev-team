# Agent & Skill Registry (Full)

This file contains the complete registry tables. CLAUDE.md references this file for on-demand loading — the orchestrator reads it when routing decisions require the full catalog.

## Review Agents

Spawned by the orchestrator during Phase 3 inline checkpoints and full `/code-review` runs. Each agent declares its own `model:`/`effort:` frontmatter — the native Claude Code sub-agent contract the harness resolves directly (see **Model/Effort Resolution** in `agents/orchestrator.md`). The frontmatter is the single source of truth; it is not mirrored here.

Each row below is also classified as a **discovery lens** or **verification gate** — the two need different value metrics (`$/finding` vs. escape rate). See [`review-lens-classification.md`](review-lens-classification.md) (#2007) for the classification and rationale.

| Agent | File | What It Checks |
| ------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| a11y-review | `agents/a11y-review.md` | WCAG 2.1 AA, ARIA, keyboard nav, focus management |
| ai-provenance-review | `agents/ai-provenance-review.md` | AI-authored test assertion verification debt, regeneration-risk candidates (magic values, unusual ordering) with no human-verification evidence |
| arch-review | `agents/arch-review.md` | ADR compliance, layer boundary violations, dependency direction, pattern consistency |
| claude-setup-review | `agents/claude-setup-review.md` | CLAUDE.md completeness, rules, skills, path accuracy |
| component-architecture-review | `agents/component-architecture-review.md` | Reusable component extraction, frontend UI duplication, prop drilling, component granularity, inconsistent component APIs |
| concurrency-review | `agents/concurrency-review.md` | Race conditions, async pitfalls, shared state |
| correctness-review | `agents/correctness-review.md` | Functional/behavioral defects — implementation diverges from evident intent |
| data-flow-tracer | `agents/data-flow-tracer.md` | Data flow tracing through architecture layers (analysis-only) |
| doc-review | `agents/doc-review.md` | README accuracy, API doc alignment, inline comment drift, ADR update triggers |
| domain-review | `agents/domain-review.md` | Domain boundaries, abstraction leaks, entity/DTO confusion |
| js-fp-review | `agents/js-fp-review.md` | Array mutations, impure patterns, global state, point-free/composition opportunities |
| mutation-kill | `agents/mutation-kill.md` | Autonomous survivor-reduction loop — generates targeted tests, verifies, commits, repeats; gates on hard kills only (Go advisory). Not a reviewer; invoked per Story by `/test-improve` Phase 5 or directly |
| naming-review | `agents/naming-review.md` | Intent-revealing names, boolean prefixes, magic values |
| performance-review | `agents/performance-review.md` | Resource leaks, N+1 queries, unbounded growth |
| progress-guardian | `agents/progress-guardian.md` | Plan adherence, commit discipline, scope creep detection |
| quality-reviewer | `agents/quality-reviewer.md` | Coordinates the Inline Review Checkpoint's review agents and drives the fix loop — Stage 2 of the three-stage inline review, distinct from the `spec-reviewer`/`spec-compliance-review` spec-matching gates. Dispatched by `agents/orchestrator.md` Phase 3, never directly. |
| refactor-opportunity-review | `agents/refactor-opportunity-review.md` | Post-GREEN refactoring opportunities, semantic vs structural duplication |
| security-review | `agents/security-review.md` | Injection, auth/authz, data exposure, crypto |
| session-analysis | `agents/session-analysis.md` | Maps an aggregated session digest to probable plugin causes and ranked, tagged improvement suggestions (analysis-only) |
| spec-compliance-review | `agents/spec-compliance-review.md` | Spec-to-code matching — general first gate before quality review (final `/code-review` gate; pre-build criteria-verification mode and batched/complex-slice checkpoints in `/build`) |
| spec-reviewer | `agents/spec-reviewer.md` | Spec-to-diff matching for a single freshly-implemented unit — Stage 1 of the three-stage inline review, narrower and diff-scoped vs. `spec-compliance-review`'s broader file-scoped check. Dispatched by `agents/orchestrator.md` Phase 3, never directly. |
| structure-review | `agents/structure-review.md` | SRP violations, DRY, coupling, file organization, nesting depth, cognitive load, async-pattern judgment (folds `complexity-review`, retired #2093) |
| angular-reactivity-review | `agents/angular-reactivity-review.md` | Angular Zone.js change-detection pitfalls, OnPush + immutability violations, RxJS subscription leaks |
| react-reactivity-review | `agents/react-reactivity-review.md` | React hook rules, stale closures in useEffect, missing dependency arrays, subscription leaks |
| vue-reactivity-review | `agents/vue-reactivity-review.md` | Vue ref/reactive unwrapping pitfalls, watchEffect dependency tracking, subscription leaks |
| test-review | `agents/test-review.md` | Coverage gaps, assertion quality, test hygiene |
| test-smell-review | `agents/test-smell-review.md` | xUnit test smells, test-double selection, test-pyramid layer placement |
| token-efficiency-review | `agents/token-efficiency-review.md` | File/function size, LLM anti-patterns, token usage |

## Color Convention

Every agent declares `color:` (display color in the task list/transcript),
required by this-repo convention on top of the optional official field
(ADR 0027, same category as the `effort: high` convention, ADR 0026).
Derived mechanically, not hand-picked — priority order, capability checked
before naming:

1. `tools:` contains `Agent` (bare or `Agent(...)`) → **purple** (orchestrator).
2. Else `tools:` contains `Edit` or `Write` → **yellow** (changes files).
3. Else name ends `-review` or starts `plan-review-` → **green** (reviewer).
4. Else → **cyan** (all others).

Current fleet: 2 purple, 8 yellow, 32 green, 19 cyan (61 agents total, no
ties). `tests/agents/test_agent_fleet_conventions.py` asserts every agent's
declared `color:` matches the rule; `agent-create`/`agent-add` suggest the
computed value the same way they already do `model:`/`effort:`.

## Skills/Memory Convention

Two more this-repo conventions on top of optional official fields (ADR 0028,
same category as ADR 0026/0027):

- **`skills:`** — any agent with a `## Skills` section in its body must
  declare a matching, non-empty `skills:` preload list, each name traceable
  to that section's own text. No `## Skills` section → omit `skills:`.
- **`memory:`** — any agent with `Edit`/`Write` in `tools:` must declare
  exactly `memory: project` (no other value, no omission). Neither tool →
  omit `memory:`.

Current fleet: 12/61 agents carry `skills:`, 9/61 carry `memory: project`.
Same test file as color (`tests/agents/test_agent_fleet_conventions.py`)
asserts both, via pure `classify_skills_declaration()` /
`classify_memory_declaration()` functions; `agent-create`/`agent-add`
suggest-and-confirm both the same way they already do `color:`.

## Skills Registry

Skills are reusable knowledge modules in `.claude/skills/` that agents reference. They define patterns, guidelines, and project structures without being tied to any single agent persona.
