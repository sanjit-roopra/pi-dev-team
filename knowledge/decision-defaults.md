# Decision Defaults

High-reversal-cost decision axes that recur across tasks and, when guessed wrong,
force an interrupt and rework. For each axis: the trigger that raises it, the default
stance, and what to confirm before committing. Screen every non-trivial request
against this list during discovery; surface any ambiguous axis in a single upfront
batch — **each with its recommended default attached** — rather than guessing and
being corrected later. A surfaced axis with no recommended default is incomplete: it
makes the user do the deciding from a blank, which is the menu anti-pattern this list
exists to prevent. State your best answer for each axis and let the user override it.

These are defaults, not laws — an explicit user instruction always wins. The point is
to resolve the axis *before* building, not to relitigate it mid-stream.

**Non-interactive runs.** When no human can answer the upfront batch (headless
`/plan`/`/build`, `--yes`, `DEV_TEAM_AUTO_APPROVE=1`), surfacing degrades to
recording: take the recommended default for every ambiguous axis, state each axis and
stance in the plan (and, via `/pr`, the PR body) — and **never take a non-default
stance on any axis without an explicit user instruction**. A non-default stance with
nobody present to confirm it is a guess, not a decision; if the task appears to
require one, that is an escalation, not an assumption.

## Destructive shape: replace vs. merge

Trigger: a request writes config, settings, dotfiles, or installer output where prior
content may exist. Default: **recommend merge — preserve existing content** — because
it is the reversible option; a clean replace discards prior settings and is hard to
undo. Surface the choice before acting, but always with that merge default attached —
never a bare "merge or replace?". Confirm: does the user want existing content
preserved (merge, the recommended default) or overwritten (replace)? When unstated and
the target is non-trivial, surface the choice with the merge default and proceed once
it is resolved; do not silently act in either direction.

## Format fidelity: preserve the native format

Trigger: handling a vector or structured asset (SVG, source diagram, lossless data).
Default: preserve the native, lossless form; do not down-convert (for example, SVG to
PNG) for convenience. Confirm: if a conversion seems necessary, name the reason and
get agreement before doing it.

## Evolution: migrate vs. edit a stub in place

Trigger: a target has been renamed, deprecated, or replaced by a successor (a plugin,
module, or file with a forwarding stub). Default: migrate to the current target rather
than editing the deprecated stub in place. Confirm: verify which artifact is canonical
before changing it — a stub edit that looks done can leave the real target untouched.

## Integration: auto-merge vs. direct-to-trunk

Trigger: landing changes on a shared branch. Default: open a PR and use auto-merge
gated on green checks rather than merging directly to trunk. Confirm: only merge
directly when the user has asked for it; a direct merge can bypass checks and lose work.

## Scope: touch only what was requested

Trigger: a request names specific files, slides, or targets. Default: change only
those; do not expand scope to adjacent items. Confirm: if neighboring changes seem
warranted, propose them separately rather than folding them in unasked.

## Re-capture: keep vs. overwrite an existing tracked artifact

Trigger: a worker is about to re-run an expensive capture for an artifact that
already has a tracked copy for the same key (e.g. a coverage baseline, a mutation
history entry, a benchmark snapshot). Default: **keep** — recommend reuse of the
existing tracked artifact, and confirm before discarding what may be a comparison
baseline. Overwriting without confirmation risks silently invalidating the
baseline every later phase measures against.

Mechanics:

- **Interactive**: prompt keep/overwrite with default keep. An unrecognized answer
  (anything other than "keep" or "overwrite", case-insensitive) re-prompts with the
  identical choice — never silently falls back to either option. There is no retry
  limit and no timeout; the guard keeps re-prompting until it receives "keep" or
  "overwrite".
- **Non-interactive** (no usable TTY, or `DEV_TEAM_AUTO_APPROVE=1`): keep the
  existing tracked artifact automatically, without prompting. The auto-decision is
  both **logged** (to the worker's own record/audit trail) **and echoed** to run
  output — a decision recorded only to a file the operator never sees is not an
  auto-decision the operator can trust.
- **Existing file is malformed or corrupt**: if the existing tracked artifact fails to parse
  (e.g. invalid JSON from a prior interrupted write), treat it as absent — never
  silently keep a file that cannot be read back. Emit a warning naming why a fresh
  capture is happening.

Confirm: on overwrite, replace the tracked artifact with the fresh capture; on keep
(or an equivalent non-interactive default), skip the expensive capture entirely and
reuse the existing artifact's recorded values.
