# Test Doubles

Reference file for `test-smell-review`, `test-review`, and the `test-design-advisor` skill. A test double is any object that stands in for a real collaborator in a test. Choosing the wrong kind of double is the most common cause of fragile, over-specified tests.

Source taxonomy: Gerard Meszaros, *xUnit Test Patterns* (xunitpatterns.com). Language-agnostic — described by role, not by any mocking library's API.

Core principle: **prefer the simplest double that lets the test verify the behavior.** Reach for a Mock only when the interaction *is* the behavior under test. Over-mocking couples tests to implementation and produces the Overspecified Software smell (see `test-smells.md`).

## The Five Doubles

| Double | What it does | Verification style | Use when |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Dummy** | Passed but never used; fills a required parameter | none | A constructor/method signature demands an argument the test path never touches |
| **Stub** | Returns canned answers to calls made during the test | **state** (assert on the SUT's output/state) | The SUT *reads* from a collaborator and you need to control what it reads (config, query result, clock) |
| **Spy** | A stub that also records how it was called, for later inspection | **behavior** (assert after the act) | You need to confirm an outgoing call happened, but want to assert *after* the action, not pre-program expectations |
| **Mock** | Pre-programmed with expectations; fails the test if calls don't match | **behavior** (expectations verified) | The interaction itself is the observable behavior (e.g., "an email *is sent*") and there's no state to assert on |
| **Fake** | A working but lightweight implementation (in-memory DB, in-memory queue) | **state** | A stub/mock would need so much call-by-call setup that a real-ish implementation is simpler and more faithful |

A **Test Spy** and a **Mock** both do behavior verification; the difference is *when* and *how* you specify expectations. Spy = act, then assert on recorded calls. Mock = set expectations up front, library verifies them. Spies usually read better and fail less cryptically.

## State Verification vs. Behavior Verification

| | State verification | Behavior verification |
|---|---|---|
| **Asserts on** | The SUT's return value or resulting state | The calls the SUT made to collaborators |
| **Doubles used** | Stub, Fake | Mock, Spy |
| **Coupling** | Low — survives refactors that preserve outcome | High — breaks when the *how* changes, even if outcome is identical |
| **Default?** | **Yes — prefer this** | Only when there's no observable state to assert |

Rule of thumb: if you *can* assert on a result or a state change, do that and use a Stub/Fake. Use a Mock/Spy only for genuine side-effect-only boundaries — sending a message, writing to a log/queue, calling a payment gateway — where the call is the whole point.

## Choosing a Double (decision flow)

```
Does the SUT READ from the collaborator (needs a controlled answer)?
├─ YES → can you then assert on the SUT's output or state?
│        ├─ YES → Stub (state verification). Done.
│        └─ NO, the read drives a side effect you must confirm → Spy
│
Does the SUT only WRITE to the collaborator (side-effect-only boundary)?
├─ YES → is the call itself the behavior under test (email sent, event published)?
│        ├─ YES → Mock or Spy (behavior verification)
│        └─ NO, it's incidental → Dummy or a no-op Stub; don't assert on it
│
Is per-call stub/mock setup so heavy it obscures the test?
└─ YES → Fake (in-memory implementation), assert on its resulting state
```

## How the double is built: Configurable vs. Hard-Coded

The five doubles above are *roles*; this is the orthogonal question of *how the double gets its canned answers*. Both forms are legitimate — the choice is about reuse vs. transparency.

| Form | What it is | Use when | Watch for |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Configurable Test Double** | A reusable double the test programs at run time with the values to return / calls to expect (what Mockito/JMock/NSubstitute/Sinon generate) | The same collaborator is doubled across many tests with different canned values; you want one mechanism, configured per test | Configuration becomes so verbose it obscures the test — a sign to extract a builder or downgrade a Mock to a Stub |
| **Hard-Coded Test Double** | A purpose-built class (or *Inner Test Double* — a nested/anonymous class, or a Test-Specific Subclass) with the canned values **baked into its code** | The behavior is specific to one or a few tests; a framework can't express it; or you want a named, self-documenting stand-in | Proliferation of one-off double classes; if it recurs with varying data, switch to a Configurable form |

Neither is "better." Reach for a **Configurable** double when one collaborator is stubbed many ways across the suite; reach for a **Hard-Coded** double when a specific, named behavior reads more clearly than per-test configuration (or the framework can't produce it).

---

## Test-Specific Subclass

When you can't substitute a collaborator from outside — the dependency is created internally, or the thing you need to control is a *method of the SUT itself* — subclass the real class **in the test** and override just the seam method to inject an indirect input or null out an unwanted side effect.

```
// Override only the narrow seam; inherit everything else real
class TestableOrderService extends OrderService:
  override fetchRate(): return 1.25   // control one indirect input
```

Use it to: gain control of an indirect input without a full injection refactor; expose a protected hook for the test; or stand up a Hard-Coded double by subclassing a real collaborator. **Constraints** (from *Don't Modify the SUT*, `test-automation-principles.md`): override **only** what the test must control — never a method whose behavior this test is verifying, or you're testing the override, not the code. Treat it as a bridge toward a real seam (`testability-patterns.md`), not a permanent design.

## Common Misuses (flag these)

| Misuse | Why it's wrong | Fix |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Mocking a value object or pure function | Nothing to verify; adds coupling for zero benefit | Use the real object |
| Mocking the type under test | You're testing the mock, not the code | Use the real SUT; double only its *collaborators* |
| Asserting exact call order/count when order doesn't matter | Overspecified Software smell; fragile | State verification, or assert only the call that matters |
| Stub returns drive an `if` that's never asserted | Dead control; the test proves nothing about that branch | Assert the branch's effect, or remove the setup |
| A Mock where a Stub would do (no side-effect being verified) | Tests implementation detail instead of outcome | Downgrade to Stub + state assertion |
| Mocking a concrete class instead of an interface/port | Couples to the implementation type; see `testability-patterns.md` | Extract an interface/port; double that |
| Mocking a collaborator internal to / owned by the same component or bounded context as the SUT | This is a boundary-selection error, distinct from the injection-mechanism problem above — the collaborator isn't a true external-boundary system (third-party API, another team's service, infra the team doesn't control), it's part of what should be under test. Applies at or below the component layer regardless of whether the test declares itself solitary or sociable — no unit-test exemption exists | Assemble the real component and exercise the collaborator as real (sociable unit/component test); double only when the collaborator matches a named blocker — see `internal-collaborator-doubling.md` for the full rule and `component-test-patterns.md`'s core principle |

---

## Relationship to testability

If a collaborator can't be substituted at all (new-ed up internally, static singleton, hidden global), that's a **production-code** problem, not a test problem — introduce a seam per `testability-patterns.md` (constructor injection, interface extraction) before choosing a double. The double taxonomy assumes the collaborator is already injectable.

## Boundaries

- Don't flag a Fake (in-memory repo/DB) as "not testing the real thing" — at unit/integration level a Fake is a legitimate, often *better*, choice than a heavily-stubbed real dependency. Real-dependency fidelity is the job of contract and integration tests (see `test-pyramid.md`, `microservice-testing.md`).
- A single Mock at a true side-effect boundary is correct, not a smell. The smell is *pervasive* mocking that pins down internal call sequences.
