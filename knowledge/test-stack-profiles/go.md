# Stack profile — Go

Resolves `test-design-advisor`'s abstract layer (`test-pyramid.md`) to the canonical Go tool. Go's standard `testing` package covers most layers; reach for libraries sparingly.

| Layer | Tool | How to assert |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Unit | `testing` + table-driven tests; interfaces only for a blocker collaborator (`internal-collaborator-doubling.md`) | call the function; stdlib `if got != want` or testify/assert |
| Component / Service | `net/http/httptest` (`httptest.NewServer` / `ResponseRecorder`) | drive the handler in-process; double outbound deps via interfaces |
| Integration | Testcontainers-go (real DB/broker) | repository/SQL/driver against a real dependency |
| Contract | Pact-go | consumer↔provider agreement (`microservice-testing.md`) |
| E2E | `rod` / `chromedp`, or `go test` driving the built binary | critical journeys only |
| BDD (optional) | Godog — component/service + E2E scenarios | `godog.TestSuite{}.Run(t)` inside `go test`; steps drive the same in-process handlers |

**Notes.** Define narrow interfaces at the consumer and substitute them only when the collaborator matches a blocker (`internal-collaborator-doubling.md`) — idiomatic Go doubling, no mock framework needed (generate with `moq`/`mockgen` only when hand-writing is tedious). For outbound HTTP, **`go-vcr`** is the preferred record-and-replay tool for that adapter — see `../virtual-service-libraries.md` for the full preferred/backup catalog. Inject a clock (`func() time.Time`) rather than calling `time.Now()` in logic. Use the race detector (`go test -race`) on concurrency-bearing code. Fuzzing is built in (`func FuzzX(f *testing.F)`) — see `../testing-techniques/fuzz.md`.

**BDD.** Use Godog when non-technical stakeholders need to read or co-author scenarios (see `../references/bdd-value-guide.md` for the decision rubric). Godog wires directly into `go test` via `godog.TestSuite{}.Run(t)` — no separate test binary required. Install steps and the `godog.ErrPending` stub: `bdd-frameworks.md`.
